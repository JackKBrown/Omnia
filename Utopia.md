### Script
The utopian script is a syllabary where every character represents a syllable but also the characters individually represent ideas, Syllables can be reversed to a 'receptive form' making word couplings e.g "Bre" and "Fe"  join to make the coupling "Breith" this typically symbolises a particular subsection of the second syllable or a property of the second symbol in this case the first knowledge or record. A double sylable means the opposit of a thing
