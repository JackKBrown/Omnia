As the vision faded, the bolt of chaos and her own innate order had combined into an Aeonic metal staff, which she could easily channel her powers through. She defeated the cult leader, and journeyed back to the Dice. With the help of the Pirate King, they removed the corrupt govenor and established a democracy that was publically endorsed (for now) by the Trickster. Celeste and Luna eventually managed to get to the Dice and took Zethe back with them, who was more than a little shaken by the day's events.</p>"},{"location":"Characters/Zethe/#crozetta-and-the-ringmaster","title":"Crozetta and The Ringmaster","text":"<p>As they left Eastport to head north towards Petragenis, they came across the city of Crozetta, who were about to celebrate Comasation - a drinking festival. As they planned to rest for a few days, the group heard that there were issues with dissapearances around the city. Zethe decided that any revelry would have to wait, and that she'd try to get to the bottom of what was happening. As she worked alongside the guards, she heard that Lady Damocles was one of the people who had been kidnapped, and her son was nowhere to be found. In addition, a strange circus had come to town with unusual monsters. They found that this Cirque was led by The Ringmaster, a powerful Iumaten worshipper who was working with the Chuul and sacrificing people to create monsters. After invading the cirque and capturing the Ringmaster, they interrogated him. It seemed that the Chuul wanted an ancient crown that Lady Damocles had found and hidden within her house, alongside her son who they found. Planning to use the crown as a bargaining chip, Zethe travelled to the sewers to try to find the Chuul and rescue the captives. It was in the sewers that Zethe's 'other half' took over and slaughtered a group of attacking Sea Devils, much to Zethe's confusion and distress. Using the crown as a distraction, they defeated the Chuul and rescued Lady Damocles, who was reunited with her son. Zethe and Helena became fast friends, and they met with a small wizarding society, full of hobbyists. Zethe also discovered a hidden room within her mindscape that looked like her parent's room with a mirror within - her reflection seemed to be the 'other Zethe', which at the time was unable to form coherrent sentences. As Zethe relaxed in the Comasation celebrations, the Ringmaster escaped custody. Asking the wizarding society for help, Zethe called upon her heritage to summon a Zelekut to chase the Ringmaster down. The group followed after the inevitable, and eventually made their way to Jens. </p>"},{"location":"Characters/Zethe/#jens-and-uber-seccentium","title":"Jens and Uber-Seccentium","text":"<p>On the way, Alph-E declade himself the leader of a goblin group who worshipped \"The Mean One\". Upon arriving in Jens, Zethe tried to save a caravan of people from Alm assassins, who has burned their wares and kidnapped the people in order to steal an artifact. They tracked them down to a cave where the merchants were kept prisoner - to be later used as slaves - and the group fought a hydra for their freedom. In this fight, the other Zethe came out and tried to kill the hydra, and injured Luna in the process. As they entered the city proper, Zethe promised to help find the missing child, and aimed to investigate the Alm family thinking that they might still have him - or worse, potentially send him to The Maw. She also looked for signs of the Zelekut, who had dissapeated in Jens, giving chase to the Ringmaster. As she made to look for the child, she and Celeste broke into the Alm headquarters to try to find out more information, but were both caught and sent to the night's Maw. Thanks to Celeste, they could both keep their weapons. While she tried to keep spirits up in the Maw cage with the other prisoners who were to fight and die for entertainment, she was unsuccessful, and she ended up losing herself to the 'other Zethe' during the conflict. When she awoke, she was surrounded by a large number of people with broken bones - but thankfully not dead. Still shaken, she and Celeste pushed themselves downwards towards the centre of The Maw and found Luna fighting the current champion, with K'Chanu nowhere in sight. They managed to beat the champion, but where chased by Alm guards and had to retreat into the tunnels that surrounded the Maw. Thankfully, this was where the Zelekhut had fled after the Ringmaster and they began to make their way down the tunnels. Eventually they came across a group of Skum, who said that the Zelekhut, Ringmaster, and what sounded like Eliopeth had fled down into a portal that they were terrified of. Knowing that this distruption had a chance of breaking this forbidden seal, they agreed to help reopen it with the agreement that the group would help.</p> <p>As it was opened, the group saw a terrifying sight ahead of them - a fleshy tunnel with mechanical parts jutting out of it. Zethe and Alph-E couldn't comprehend the environment, almost 'glitching' as they tried to understand what they saw. Eventually both seemed to cut off from the Breithmaehut, and could finally perceive the environment. As they journeyed through the tunnel, they saw the Zelekhut - this time transformed with viscera lining its body, and mortal spines instead of chains. It seemed to know Zethe, insisting that it would take her to her mother, and seemed confused when she fought back. They managed to scale the cliff, but Zethe was cut off by another mechanical monster. The Other Zethe broke through again, and when Zethe awoke, she was standing over an injured Eliopeth, strangling her. She quickly let go, very confused, and then spoke with Eliopeth who explained that she thought Zethe was a tyrant who worked with Celeste, who had previously called for the slaughter of her people. Despite their mistrust of one another, they agreed to work together to find Celeste and Luna. As they slept, Zethe was visited in her mindscape by Uber Seccentium, who tried to persuade her to join her side; despite her protests, the Amalgam God inserted evil knowledge into the library, unwilling teaching Zethe awful spells - and tracking the two of them down. They woke up, and had to fight their way out of the cave they rested in. While successful, they were in a panic about where to go and so they had to devise a plan - Zethe would not go to sleep for as long as possible, and once they had an idea of what to do, she'd hide the knowledge from Uber Seccentium by transferring it to the Other Zethe in the mirror. Eventually, the plan she came up with was to combine the Iumaten crown, Eliopeth's chaos magic, and the black oil of the god to transform it into a new form of God Metals, based off her staff. With this in mind, she took off to find the source, and managed to find Celeste and Luna on the way, fighting off a corrupted Marut as she did. With the group together, Celeste and Eliopeth - who could both enter Zethe's mindscape - agreed to distract Uber Seccentium long enough for Zethe to transfer the plan to the Other Zethe. On the way, they found the injured Ringmaster, who she decided to spare, not wanting to prove his chidings about Breithmaehut and herself correct. They made their way through the fleshy landscape towards the centre - a huge cathedral of muscle and bone where the oil flowed out from. On the inside, they discovered the person who invited the dark god to this area of the Underdark, and slew him. As they arrived into the inner sanctum, Zethe managed to channel Uber Seccentium's power, alongside Luna, Eliopeth, and the crown, creating a strange Aeonic Beacon. As they escaped the crumbling cathedral, they saw the amalgamated creatures collapse and die, and eventually the group could rest. As they did so, Zethe received a dream from Breithmaehut, who explained what Uber Seccentium is, and that she would have to be quarentined. Zethe didn't take the news well at all, and secluded herself away in a depressed rage. </p> <p>Eventually she left the underdark with the help of Celeste and Luna, with Eliopeth leaving, and they aimed to rescue both K'Chanu and the child. Despite Zethe's mood, they heard whispers of a man who had bought a large amount of parephenalia from the Uber Seccentium site, and they went into his house to remove it. With trickery and subterfuge, Celeste, Luna, and Zethe retrieved a book written by the first founder of Laerhyme, and destroyed an amalgamation mask. She also saw an old statue of Breithmaehut which was a subtle blasphemy, and belonged to an anti-Breithmaen cult who didn't forgive the god for abandonning them at the creation of Uber Seccentium. They also found tracks of K'Chanu, and saw that he'd been kidnapped by the Alm as an exhibition piece in the Maw. While they did rescue him, he was very badly injured and Zethe used the Aeonic Beacon to restore his health over a period of days, learning that this beacon may be able to save his people should they be able to get it back to them. The work helped set her mind at ease, and they learned that the child may be with the Coll - the owners of the Maw. She went to that family, who offered her the child in return for taking a loss for the leader's son in the Maw, but they renegged on the deal and gave her the wrong child, and she was made to fight the son, who was kitted out in the best equipment money could buy. Despite this, he was untrained, and Zethe prevailed - though found her mind merged with that of the Other Zethe, and very nearly killed the son, thought stopped herself. She did however take the very expensive sword, and threaten to make off with it if she wasn't given information about the missinng child. The leader of the Coll reluctantly agreed, and told them of a place the child had been traded to by the Alm. They broke in with difficulty, and found that the child was being experimented on by strumrock kowl, who was using Illumite - another Aeonic metal. Kowl escaped, but Zethe did retrieve his wand of feeblemind, as well as a wand of Compell True Name - and not to mention rescuing the child, who was returned to the travellers. Zethe and the group were kicked out very soon afterwards, and had to make their escape from Jens.</p>"},{"location":"Characters/Zethe/#journey-to-laerhyme","title":"Journey to LaerHyme","text":"<p>Just as they set off, Zethe tried to identify the wands she had confiscated, and accidentally cast Compell True Name on Celeste, instinctively knowing 'Paradisia' was his true name, which shook Celeste badly. Working through it, a strange ebon door formed in her mindscape, which allowed her and Celeste to join with one another more easily. In the swamps of Jens, they searched for the Chuul that had attacked Lady Damocles, and found a shrine that activated when blood was spilled - they're not sure what it did, but it probably wasn't good. They also found a locket that likely belonged to Lord Damocles when he was killed.</p> <p>Journeying further still, the group was distracted by a strange floating helmet, which led them into an old abandonned temple. The creatures in the temple seemed to belong to the The Forgotten God and The Holy Triumvirate, and they attacked Celeste on sight, badly hurting him. Eventually Luna and Zethe found the winged helmet and mercy killed it, but Zethe learned of its construction and took some of its metal dust to try to use, to allow the archon another chance to serve its duty.</p> <p>On the road, the group went to Myrdor as it was electing a new mayor, which appeared to be a cursed position - the past five mayors had died of plague, and Letisha Laewtiz was seemingly next. After investigating, it seemed that Letisha was the one causing the deaths, due to her being mistreated by the village. While what she had done would be punishable by death, Zethe felt sympathy for her position, and elected to save her with the Geas spell - forcing her to help others for the rest of her days. </p> <p>After this, they journeyed further along the road, they came across Pilgrim's Hollow, which seemed to be haunted. However, on further observation, it seemed that it was the Fae who were causing the issues, so Zethe and Luna journeyed further into the forest to confront the invaders. They met up with Wilt, a leshy, who was very excited to speak with them and told them of his misstress, who wished to reclaim the village as she believed mortals had been expanding more than she thought they should. Zethe and Wilt managed to engage in diplomacy between the village and the Fae, who agreed to work with one another for a more environmemtally sustainable settlement. Wilt, however, was kicked out from the court and joined the group. Celeste and Luna decided to leave towards Linthumveil to investigate Luna's nightmares more, leaving Zethe, Letisha, Wilt, and K'Chanu to go to LaerHyme. </p>"},{"location":"Characters/Zethe/#laerhyme","title":"LaerHyme","text":"<p>As Zethe's group arrived, they were attacked at the gates by giant defensive golem, who were designed to prevent attack from extraplanar beings, which Zethe triggered. Thankfully the misunderstanding was caught by one of the professors, who took them into the city of LaerHyme. The group was given very nice accomodation, and Zethe met up with Lady Damocles again, and they caught up on what had been happening. Zethe was then taken to speak with Director Edgewater, who was very curious to know more both about her and the Cassissian helmet she was crafting. Another interesting person was Filigree, the Soulless construct professor of LaerHyme - she was very curious with Zethe, and they got on very well. Unfortunately, due to Filigree showing Zethe off to the other teachers, it meant that Zethe would have to perform an entrance exam. Before doing so, she helped out around the city and stopped a large Pumpking from destroying the botany classroom, and saw a Sfirfneblin skulking about in the sewers. Edgewater seemed concerned, but they couldn't find anything and so the entrance exam went ahead as normal, but at the end the floor collapsed under her. Filigree pushed Zethe out of the way, and fell down the hole, getting kidnapped by a Sfirfneblin at the bottom. Zethe gave chase, and ended up in an old underground part of the university.</p> <p>As Zethe explored further, she found the Pumpking again and tried to bargain with him, eventually settling on a truce if she brought up one of him Pumlings to the surface to speak with the botancy professor. After trying to get through the locked door, she went through a gap in the wall and found a strange workbench with mad mathmatical scratchings in the wall. There was a corrupted Axiomatic creature within - the remnants of the founder of LaerHyme - who had the almagamation rune deep within. It seemed Uber Seccentium was back. In a panic, she just about managed to best him, and worked out the combination to get through the locked door. When she did, she found it lead to the Underdark - and a university beneath. Travelling downwards, she found that Strumrock Kowl had returned here and become the director of the university, killing the old director - and worse, he seemed to be using the teachings of Uber Seccentium, putting not just Kindling in danger, but potentially the entire surface world as well. Knowing she needed to put a stop to this, and to rescue Filigree, she worked with the townsfolk to break into the university and made her way to the top floor. It seemed like Kowl had been struggling to create Breithmatite - the metal Zethe makes - but had figured out that his false metal could be augmented with flesh. As she moved into his office, she saw Filigree on an operating table, and immediately tried to free her. As she did, Kowl revealed himself and one of his new creations - a golem of flesh and metal. Even Kowl had augmented himself, transforming his legs into the same chitin as she has seen before. As the battle ensued, Zethe caused a lot of damage to the monstrosity but it managed to tie her down to a binding machine designed to steal energy from beings from Utopia. Thankfully Edgewater came down to fight Kowl, but he was betrayed by one of the LaerHyme teachers, Balthazar. Even then, Edgewater managed to fight off his attackers and subdued the traitor as Zethe broke from her bindings and killed the monstrosity, giving chase to Kowl who managed to escape, but not before leaving behind a notebook that used to belong to the first founder of LaerHyme.</p> <p>In a desperate bid to put a stop to Kowl, Zethe performed the Gease ritual on Balthazar and forced him to search for the madman - hoping that he would be able to use their past connections to track him down.

Worried, she set off towards the historic town. Zethe travelled there alongside Filigree, and on the way, the professor began build a set of wings upon the godspawn's back which she could channel her energy through to fly. Unfortunately, in order to generate lift through this energy, they would need to follow the same design of her staff - they would need chaotic energy to clash with her ordered magic.</p> <p>They entered Linthumveil only to find that the adults of the town had dissapeared, and the children were too terrified to leave their homes. A huge man with a red cape had taken their parents, and what initially seemed like a normal housecat prowled the town The children of Linthumveil were scared of the small creature, and it quickly revealed itself to be 'blessed' by Iumatre, transforming into a powerful monster; upon defeat, it reverted to a human form - a young woman who was very confused about her situation.</p> <p>Zethe and Filigree delved further into the mystery, finding a circle of loadstones that represented the Holy Triumvariate; the slabs of Breithmaehut and Iroas were destroyed, but the stone of Illuminir had dissapeared. Searching further, they found the stone within a well and took it with them; it seemed the stone had protected the children from Iumatre's grasp. Going back to the town, the children finally told them of an abandonned mine. As expected, Iumater's servants had taken up hold in this cavern; unexpectantly, this cave was once a temple of Grisconere - an Agathion of metalwork. Within this mine, there were cystals that caused illness in those who were around them long enough, and often drove them mad - going as far as to have people praising the gems. Fighting through werewolves and cultists, the duo found Elliopeth locked in combat with a huge aquatic monster. They managed to bring it down together, and Elliopeth explained she was here while chasing The Ringmaster. Worried about what he may be doing to her friends, she pressed onwards and found Celeste - alongside some of the remaining adults - caged and guarded by a group of werewolves. They broke him out, but had little time for reunions - The Ringmaster was doing something awful to Luna.</p> <p>Rushing through the final parts of the crumbling temple, they found The Ringmaster and a group of other powerful cultists performing some sort of ritual upon Luna, who was stuck snarling within a cage. He seemed to be turning her feral, and as he noted the intruders, he set his new beast upon them. Luna was a potent foe, and combined with the power of the cultists, Zethe and her friends struggled to hold their ground. It was only when Zethe tried to reach through to Luna did the tides change, and the child of Illuminir managed to break from Iumatre's hold and turned on The Ringmaster - whose failure had caught the ire of his goddess, who quickly transformed him and his minions into mindless oozes. In her victory, Luna was visited in a dream by her mother, who told her how proud she was - and that she never abandonned her, but that she was sorry for the pain she caused.</p> <p>Linthumveil was saved, and the reuinited group celebrated. However, Celeste and Filigree grew jealous of one another over Zethe's affection, who was indecisive with who she wanted a relationship with. Elliopeth spoke to Zethe about other timelines, saying that the reason she was initially hostile was because Zethe was a threat in other timelines - a cruel and ruthless tyrant who spread their iron order around Omnia. Not believing this to be possible in this timeline, the daughter of Breithmaehut assured the daughter of Diatarachtos that she had nothing to fear; the 'Other Zethe' actually explained that Eliopeth was correct in that there were other timelines, and that this was the 'true' one - it was Elliopeth's unique presence which caused the creation of 'Other Zethe'. Elliopeth agreed to use some of her chaotic magic to finish the wings, and this newly gained 'angelic' appearance helped ignite woship from the rescued people of Linthumveil, though the godspawn was uncertain of how to wield it. Both Luna and Elliopeth took their leave, taking the werecat girl - Elizabeth - with them as they headed towards Roziegalburg. </p> <p>Just before leaving the town, Zethe visited the loadstones for a final time, and Illuminir granted her a small miricle in the form of a dream - the first she had had before transformation. Within this dream, she had a full conversation with her adoptive mother, Leisel, and they both exchanged their love for one another before vowing to see each other soon.</p>"},{"location":"Characters/Zethe/#return-to-laerhyme-and-the-aeonic-resonator","title":"Return to LaerHyme and the Aeonic Resonator","text":"<p>Working alongside the professors of LaerHyme - including Filigree - Zethe managed to harness the power of the godly alloy created beneath Jens and created the Aeonic Resonator, an artefact of almost infinite power. It worked by Utopic and Cataclysmic energy surging into one another, creating a singularity of unimaginable potency. with such power, it ripped a portal open to the Maelstrome which allowed a flood of Proteans through; while they managed to seal the portal, the room was ruined. Such a powerful item held enough energy to reignite the souls of the Conrasu on the Lost Continent, and it was just the trouble of getting it there. Considering they got there through teleportation, they would likely have to return using the same method. Unfortunately, such magic was only known by a single living person - Edgewater - and its magic was beyond Zethe's grasp. Lending her his notes, Zethe spoke to her other self in frustration - annoyed that she wasn't able to harness this potent spell immediately. 'Other Zethe' spoke with her and, in some ways, was reassuring. In their conversation, the 'Other Zethe' said that due to Elliopeth's existence, she experiences the lives of all Zethe's in all timelines at once - including all of the pain some of them are in. The news shocked Zethe, and out of empathy, she offered the 'Other Zethe' the opportunity to inhabit her body in the late night, giving her at least some chance of a life. The offer took 'Other Zethe' by surprise, not expecting to be shown kindness.</p> <p>Before leaving the City of Magic, she furthered her work on the divine alloys, finding out new combinations and working on her own runework. In preparation of leaving to Asgard, she worked with Filigree to create a litmus test for corruption, which 'Other Zethe' offered to improve. While she tested negative for 'Assimilation', she tested positive to 'Conqueror' - something that Other Zethe said she corrupted Zethe with, as she's an anomoly. She also revealed that there may be a way to break through timelines, but the exact way to do it safely wasn't known - they would need a more knowledgable teacher. Edgewater mentioned 'The Old Ones' - an ancient society who had magic to rival the gods, but one day they dissapeared; it was from the scraps of their research that he learned some of his rarest magic - including teleportation. The way it worked was through tracing back your physical past, relocating you to somewhere you have already been. </p> <p>Her friends and professors invited Zethe to a party at the end of her tenure at LaerHyme; despite her struggles with the teleportation spell, the party caused her to forget her troubles for a moment and enjoy the evening.

While the group were initially cautious about what traps the creature might have laid, they actually found that the kobolds in this cave had been killed to the last adult by a Helknight - a brutal enforcer of order. They spared the kobold, but were worried that the Helknights would return to finish the job. The dead Helknight's helmet had the Utopic runes for Wrath/Eliminate (VLI/OLV) etched into a sentence on the inside - \"Wrath/Eliminate Conquor for Order\".</p> <p>Travelling further on, the group found the town of South Listings - an offshoot of Asgard - they heard tell of a 'phantom posh person' who visited the town, drinking with the locals and sharing grand amounts of wealth and four dead sheep with them before disapearing. Such a strange apparition was causing people to get nervous and stop working on the canal project, upsetting  the town mage Parvia who had been comissioned from the mage tower. Trying to find out more about this phantom, Zethe found a woman behaving strangely - a woman who seemed to recognise Zethe and ran away, revealing that she had bird feet. Zethe gave chase, and while she lost the woman, she did manage to track her down to a cave deeper within the desert. Venturing within, they found a dwemorcat acting as a pet and being fed scrolls of powerful magic; knocking the territorial animal out, they heard deep breathing from deeper in. Creeping through the labyrinth, they found a massive brass dragon resting within. Deciding to introduce herself, Zethe found the dragon rather confrontational before they managed to convince him that they meant no harm. He introduced himself as Regalis, and explained that he was paying the village back with gifts for the drinks he'd been offered - he didn't realise they took his gifts poorly! In recompence, he agreed to reveal himself to South Listings and explain his actions. While the people were initially scared, after he completed their canal project within moments, they soon changed their tune. </p> <p>Zethe spoke with Regalis later, who explained a few tidbits of knowledge only available to him in his age. He explained that the area Asgard now sits was once part of the Fae - and it was around this point that he entered his slumber, hence his surprise at the nearby village. 'Other Zethe' asked if she would be able to speak with Regalis, which Zethe agreed to, and upon coming to she found that Regalis was begrudgingly accepting to explain timelines to her. He explained it as if a disk had been shattered - an event caused by The Old Ones which allowed mortals to be created. The fracture point is closer to the 'true reality', and as the timelines branched outwards from this True Reality, they went to the edge and faded - or else became unavailable. The Shadow Plane is what sits between the gaps of the shattering, and its magic within the Shadow Plane that allows people to use it like a bridge in teleportation magic.</p> <p>Before leaving South Listings, Zethe spoke with the local cleric there, wanting to get some perspective on her issues with Breithmaehut.

Realising it may have been a mistake, they approached the gates of the huge walled city without violent intent. Upon coming to the gate, they were greeted by a mirage of Governor Meryll Cumar, Officiate Tinswell, and Seraphina - the archmage. Seraphina didn't seem best pleased by their entrance - and explained that it was her and her mages who fired upon the group, believing them to be a threat - and it was the church who raised the flag.</p> <p>Meryll invited the group to a party, which would involve who's who in Asgard, and Zethe agreed to attend in a few days, but not before she spoke with Ebriham about the potential corruption. Going towards the church, she was greeted by Lady Damoclese, who had travelled ahead of them and was staying in her family's house in the city; she offered them a place to stay, glad to have company. Upon meeting Ebriham, she saw that he was an unexpectantly jovial old man, who said that they would have a 'deeper' chat with one another later, but that she needed patience. She considered trying to reach out to her divine mother, but decided against it - despite knowing that she was in the 'clear'.</p> <p>Going to the party, Zethe decided to put on as much as an intimidating front on as possible, trying to make herself appear far more confident than she was to the other nobles - including Meryll and The King. Meryll spoke to her in private about a group in the lower city called The Unseen - a cult that he believed had something to do with a serial killer named Alukar the Red. Because this is taking place in the lower city, he explained that there weren't enough resources to find him and that she should apprehend the killer and bring him to Meryll, as well as destroy the cult. Zethe agreed to look into it, but likely gave too much of herself away to the governor in the conversation. During the party, Celeste was approached by Arimir, the Lord of the Pillar - the chief Helknight within the city - who invited him to speak with Cessatyr in the Helknight tower.</p> <p>During the night time, she had a conversation with 'Other Zethe', who agreed to teach her more of the timeline magic to see if they could somehow pull the alternate Zethes from the awful situations they found themselves in, and ease 'Other Zethe's' suffering. As they spoke, 'Other Zethe' revealed some more of her feelings - showing that she had developed more feelings since she was permitted to live a life during the nighttime, and that she had been reading children's stories from Zethe's past - something she was embarressed to admit. </p> <p>On the next day, Zethe traveled to the market where she realised she was being followed. Upon confronting the man, she realised that it was Gregor Balthazar - the professor from LaerHyme that she had geased into searching for Kowl. As she demanded to know why he was here, he broke out into histerics and began to expand. Metal rods had been inserted into his body, and it became obvious he had become amalgamated. In terror, Zethe quickly dispatched the monster, and it spat out a bloody note written on skin from Strumrock Kowl himself. The gory letter explained that there was powerful evil lurking beneath Asgard, and that he doubted she would be able to beat it without his augmentations. Zethe was understandibly very shaken - especially as she was the one who had forced Balthazar into this fate - but she had little time to deliberate as a gryphon rider descended from above to place her under arrest for murder. While the crowd boo'd against the rider, trying to explain that the 'victim' was a monster, Zethe agreed to follow the young guard who looked all too worried about the angry mob.</p> <p>The guard introduced himself as Aeris Colswin, and explained that he'd only been a rider for a day. He also said that he was from the lower city, and that he'd had to fight his way up to get this far - and now he's worried he'll lose it all and he'll need to go back to living in the slums. As they journeyed to The Nest, Zethe could swear she spotted a masked man hiding in the crowd. Before she could investigate further, the leader of the Gryphon Riders - Farrasyl Stormwing - flew down to 'greet' them, and escort them to a meeting room within the tower. Zethe tried to explain how important it was that she speak to Ebriham - and that there was a terrible threat coming to the city if she didn't - but they managed to calm her down enough to speak about their own issued in the guard. They were overstretched and couldn't commit anyone to the Alukar case, nevermind The Unseen, and that they would give her permission to investigate under their name. Worried about Colswin, she petitioned to have him join her on the case - citing that he knew the lower city the best.

While he wasn't eager to do that, he knew there was no option to dally - he had to call a Grand Hearing. As the High Officiate, he could only call such a court a maximum of six times in his life, and summons a court hearing in Utopia from Breithmaehut herself. The sensation of trasporting her mind and soul to the Perfecr City was disorienting, and the feeling of Utopic energy filled her body once again - a strange feeling after all of this time. </p> <p>As the court formed, different members of the Council of 6000 - all Breithmaehut - took their positions as the judge, jury, prosecutor, and defense lawyer. The one next to Zethe tried to offer a comforting smile, but Zethe wasn't so happy to see them - frustrated that the first interaction she had with her mother since being quarentined was being accused of something. As the court started, Zethe defended her presence in Jens and her work with Elliopeth, explaining the reason she detected as corrupted is because of the 'Other Zethe', and that this 'Other Zethe' actually cleared Uber-Seccentium's corruption. She had to work with Elliopeth in order to seal away the Amalgamite God in the Aeonic Resonator, and her quarentine has meant that she hasn't been able to contact Breithmaehut about Strumrock Kowl and his work. She was found not guilty, and thus safe from destruction, but not able to draw any compassion from her mother - who believed her actions were completely justified.</p> <p>While she couldn't articulate why it wasn't fair, she returned to the martial plane frustrated and sad. Ebriham tried to comfort her, though not by telling her what she wanted to here, and instead by trying to have her come to term with the truth that it was a bad situation that couldn't be avoided. Despite his wise words, Zethe's mood hurt Filigree, and caused her a great deal of guilt afterwards. During the nighttime, she spoke to the 'Other Zethe', who explained that her favourite fairytale she learned of was 'The Apple and the Tiger', which Leisel used to read to Zethe when she was a lot younger. </p>"},{"location":"Characters/Zethe/#the-search-for-alukar","title":"The Search for Alukar","text":"<p>Deciding to take her mind off it, she decides to plunge herself straight into the case of Alukar the Red, working closely with Colswin to find out more about the murderer. Initially, the case files mentioned that he had only attacked the citizens of the lower city, and the murders were very brutal - with the bloodless bodies being left in public places. Moreso than just the mad murderer, The Unseen have also been attacking workhouses and trying to convert the lower citizens to their cause - many of which are more than happy to join because of their lack of food.</p> <p>Hearing about this, Zethe is detirmined to not just stop Alukar, but also to stop the environment of the lower city being so poor that people have no choice but to join the cult. With resolution in her heart, she flies down to the oasis alongside Colswin to begin asking around for clues; when she's down there, Zethe discovers that students from the wizard's tower are using the oasis - used for drinking water - as their own pool. Annoyed by the disrespect, she disgiuised herself in a veil and approached them - arguing with them until eventually commanding them to clean up the streets of the lower city, revealing her true form in the process. While this was well received by the people, she made a deep enemy of Jurgen, whose uncle (Master Amir Ehrim) owns a great deal of the wheat production of the city.</p> <p>With the approval of the people, she began asking around about Alukar, and learned that the murderer had been seen in the East Quarter - the poorest area in the city, and also the area which backs onto Little Methymaenos - the dwarven district of Asgard. In addition, she also learned more about the Helknights, and how some in the lower city fear them as oppressors, and some are thankful for them as protectors. Regardless, Zethe disagreed with them trying to send a child to a workhouse for stealing food, and challenged the Helknight who was guarding a recent crime scene of Alukar's. As they argued, The Unseen tried to creep around into the crimescene - freeing the child as they did so - and summoned a demon to deal with Zethe and the Helknight. Despite the demon, their combined might managed to subdue and capture one of The Unseen, who explained that they're working with Alukar to bring something big. </p> <p>Later in the day, Zethe joined Celeste to meet Cessatyr in the Helknight Tower, hoping to talk some sense into them and getting some help with the Alukar case. When they arrived, they found that Cessatyr was Udugihawahi, one of the ancient Utopic Warriors, now a devil after selling her soul to Pesmaenos in a desperate bargain. Despite petitioning for further help, she got nowhere, besides a knock on the head from the grumpy outsider. </p> <p>While she tried to escape sleep as long as possible, she eventually succumbed to it, and Breithmaehut awaited her. While Zethe started off aggressive - upset with how her life had gone without answers about why she was so lonely as a child - eventually they both discussed their differences and reasonings, and made somewhat of a reconciliation together, with Zethe trepidatiously offering her mother a hug. Breithmaehut gifted Zethe a gavel which she could use to summon her mother in an emergency.</p> <p>The next day, Alukar had killed again in a Tin Reforging workshop, and Zethe was called to investigate the body. She found it had been totally drained of blood, though there is blood everywhere else. While there were some clues about what happened to the man, there was no clue as to where Alukar was hiding - or where he was going to strike next. Frustrated, Zethe approached the Helknights again, demanding that Udu and her knights helped the lower city with a murderer rather than arresting kids. Cessatry considers it, before agreeing to help should the godspawn prover herself in a duel. Cessatyr was an incredibly powerful outsider, but Zethe managed to get the upper hand with holy magic, and the fiend yieded - though she couldn't help but think that Udu was holding back, like she wanted to lose. Upon the end of the duel, Zethe was given permission to investigate in the Helknight's territory, and also to collaborate with the bound axiomite, Circle.</p> <p>While unable to make any large changes to the lower city, Zethe worked alongside Celeste and Filigree to buy a large amount of wheat in the city and turn it into bread for the people. With the help of the Helknights and Circle, they managed to feed a good portion of the city, but it was a drop in the water compared to the true problems the city faced. Even if they'd been fed, they'd still be at the whims of the rich who controlled their lives almost completely. </p> <p>During the night, Zethe spoke to her other self and they discussed the concept of self, and how the 'Other Zethe' viewed her own person, seeing as she was a combination of many different 'same' people. In the end, she decided that she was not just a sum of her parts, and named herself Jarah - the main character from The Apple and the Tiger. Jarah explained that she lives within a damaged soul that orbits alongside Zethe's own, and that while they are together, they are not the same. </p> <p>Renewed by the conversation, Zethe travelled to Ebriham to learn more about Utopic runes, learing about their structure and efficientcy, and how she could draw a rune from a concept. To demonstrate this, he had her cure an ill man by looking deep into his soul and finding the 'flaw'; transforming this disease into a conceptual rune, she removed it, curing him of his illness. Using this magic, she aimed to go down into the lower city and cure as many as she could of their illnesses, but on the way she was pickpocketed by a young child who Celeste caught. The boy introduced himself as Timmon, a child from the lower city, who Zethe was unwilling to relinquish to the authorities for worry of him being sent to the workhouses. Instead, as punishment, she asked him to help with the Alukar and Unseen case, knowing that he may have been in contact with The Unseen's recruitment drive, and then she'd help him by offering a home in the church's orphanage under the care of the timid Officiate Tinswill. Timmon agreed, and said that he was told that The Unseen were telling kids to go to Woolistins Lane at night for food, and he also agreed to tell his friends to instead go to Zethe for bread. Zethe asked Celeste, Filigree, and Tinswill to complete the bread creation for the poor district. During this, Timmon ended up following the quiet Tinswill around, and she agreed to look after him - and hopefully set him on the straight and narrow. </p> <p>As Zethe investigated Woolishins Lane, she was joined by Udu, who disguised them both as old women, and Colswin. They managed to find a secret door within a large building, which held instructions for scrolls and runes of summoning. The book \"A Desire for Freedom\" was found within the hidden library, but Zethe didn't have the opportunity to read it in full before they were attacked by a contingent of The Unseen. This time, they were armed with a strange black liquid, which they doused Udu with. When it touched her, her body simply fell still, and Alph-E soon followed as a second victim. It seemed that the black liquid tore away the soul of an outsider. Terrified for Alph-E (and a bit worried for Udu), she ran to Circle to ask for his help. He wasn't certain, but Jarah suggested that they may have fallen 'between the cracks' and into the Shadow Plane. The only way to get them back would be to travel there and open a door back - something that would be incredibly difficult to do. Without any other option, Zethe told everyone that she was going to go to the Shadow Plane to rescue the two of them, and that she'd go with Jarah. Sinking deep into the plane, she found herself in a totally grey plane surrounded by the corpses of Uber-Seccentium's creations which spoke to her of The Absence. She was also joined by a physical manifestation of Jarah, who quickly destroyed the amalgams. </p> <p>They fought their way through shadows of The Absence - empty and lost shades - before finding the last stand of Udu and Alph-E. Zethe and Jarah stood alongside them and just about managed to fight off the infinite shadows while the duo tried to create a link to their own timeline through positive emotional connections, and finally opened up a doorway into the plane. Zethe awoke surrounded by her friends, with a heavy weight lifted from her heart as she entered the light again. Udu, on the other hand, awoke to find herself unbound and able to exit the tower - weaker, but free of her binding. They had little time to rest, as Alukah had struck again while they were unconscious.</p> <p>Rushing to the scene of the crime - Little Methymaenos - Zethe investigated the crime scene and managed to discover a secret opening in the back of the dwarven hall. Journeying into the darkness with the gaurd Yvette. In this once lost cavern, they discovered what appeared to be a laboritory - which likely belonged to Alukar. Next to a blood-letted dead body, a shadow arose which whispered that Filigree was the key to their plans - she was part of another sacrifice, and that this timeline was the only one which their plan was possible. Chanting - similar to that which she heard from the Chu'ul cave in Jens - eachoed through the cavern, and they found Alukar within, being talked down by two Unseen. When he saw Zethe, he laughed and jumped off the cliff, followed by the two cultists, but not before they summoned a shade. In his ramblings, he mentioned that he needed to be protected from Meryll. </p> <p>Regardless, Zethe was joined by Celeste and Filigree, and they gave chase and found a giant portal - an active waygate - at the end of it. In this swirling vortex, she could see a shadowy shape lurk behind it - something massive and malevolent. Before she could focus on this, a masked man who referred to himself as The Messenger of Dead Gods emerged from the waygate. He summoned a wall of force and left with Alukar, vowing that the time would come soon when he had use for Zethe and Filigree. Bert-E explained that he could see the eyes of the creature that lurked behind the portal and he knew he should know its identity, but he couldn't remember what it was.</p>"},{"location":"Characters/Zethe/#the-unseen","title":"The Unseen","text":"<p>Realising that it was no simple derranged serial killer and that a larger plot brewed under Asgard - a plot that involved a powerful, god-like entity that could consume the timeline - Zethe set herself to work in finding out how they could be stopped. Speaking to Ebriham, he told her what he could of The Forgotten God - the 'Divine Blasphemy', where Pesmaenos fell and turned into the God of Ambition. This reminder her of the ancient temple she found of the Holy Triumvariate. Filigree also explained that she made a notebook of an etching in charcoal in the ruins she found Bert-E in which said \"and so the great triumvariate came to triumph over the hordes of Daemons and Fiends of the lower planes\". It was said that the Forgotten God led humanity into a Golden Age, and that he was the one who gave Breithmaehut Consciousness - transforming her from a Primal God to a Mortal God. She also learned that waygates used to lead to a subdomain that would act as a tunnel, but this subdimension has collapsed. Worryingly, Jarah had never seen this Absence in any other reality - and she said that this is the only reality where Zethe, Celeste, and Filigree are friends.</p> <p>Bert-E also explained that the portal gave him deja-vu, and that Zethe's helmet - made of the dust of the Cassian Helm in the ancient temple - gave him the same feeling as the Absence. As she continued her research, she managed to upset Master Amir Ehrim - the master of the grain houses - and so she lost any discount Celeste or Lady Damocles had gained on the grain, making her goals for feeding the city more difficult to achieve. In addition to this, looking at the technology The Unseen employed for the waygate, she discovered the 'Compression' rune, which she worked with Circle to create a potent bag of holding, and the groundwork of a similar extra-dimensional space. This compression rune looked similar to the corrupted runes, and Breithmaehut advised Zethe to be careful with it - and to not share it.</p> <p>After further research, Zethe learned about an abandoned waygate to the north west called Westborough in an old cave system, and in the night before journeying out, she briefly glimpsed into the other timelines and saw the horror that Jarah deals with constantly - Jarah explained that the timelines are converging, and that something of monumental importance is about to happen. Zethe, Filigree, Celeste, Colswin, Regalis, and Lady Damocles gathered together to take fight to The Unseen's likely base, with Ebriham gifting them a scroll of disintergration to deal with the wall of force that the Messenger of Dead Gods was likely to cast. Zethe learned that Tinswill had taken on Timmon as an apprentice before she set out.</p> <p>As they reached Westbrough on the back of Regalis, they saw the Unseen gathered in the abandoned town. They decided to take out The Unseen quietly, ensuring that they didn't have the chance to call for help. Quickly dispatching them, Colswin and Regalis agreed to guard the outside, and the rest ventured within. By the looks of things, the cult were using the cavern to mine opal - a very potent gem which can be used to empower magic. Throughout the cavern, the writing on the walls says \"the triumvariate watches over\", and they eventually came across an active waygate that had multiple shades slithering out of it - including a more sentient shade. Thankfully, hot on the heels of these shades, Elliopeth and Luna charged out - they'd been following the Unseen in Roziegalburg and ended up chasing through the waygate and ending up in Asgard. </p> <p>Knowing there's not much time to spare, the group surged forward and found the Messenger of Dead Gods making his way through a second waygate, which he guarded with a 'nothingness beast' and a wall of force. Using Ebriham's scroll, Zethe destroyed the wall of force and the others killed the beast, and they quickly gave chase through the portal. </p> <p>On the other side, they found a huge monument similar to the one in the Chu'ul cave, and The Messenger of Dead Gods loomed above Alukar with an intricate knife, alongside multiple shades, a nothingness beast, members of The Unseen, and a chu'ul. The group surged forward, trying to keep themselves alive while stopping the Messenger completing his ritual. One by one, he took blood from Fligree, Luna, and Zethe into his intricate dagger. Filigree managed to stop the cultist atop the ruins, Elliopeth killed the nothingness beast, Celeste banished the shade, and Lady Damocles managed to enact her revenge on the chu'ul. With a wall of stone from Zethe and a quick, decisive bite from Luna, he was stopped before the ritual could be finished, and the mournful howls of The Absence shook the cavern - collapsing it. Luna managed to drag Alukar away through the portal, and Zethe grabbed the unconscious Filigree, leaving the Messenger of Dead Gods to be crushed under his own ambition.</p> <p>It seemed, for now, The Absence's ascent had been stopped and the day was saved. </p> <p>All that remained was to gain answers from Alukar, but after hearing how scared he was to go to Meryll, she took him to the Griffon Riders first. Alukar spoke in riddles, but seemed to suggest that he could still hear The Absence, and that he needed to be release, but he cackled saying that Meryll would kill him - and that Meryll was coming for him as they spoke. As it turned out, that was true, and Meryll demanded to have Alukar handed over. Zethe thought quickly, and said that the Helknights would have to take him into their custody as he committed a crime on their land, and that the government doesn't have any right over the Helknight's prisoners. Alongside Cesstyr, Zethe marched the serial killer through the streets and towards a prison where he would have no contact with the outer planes. In this iron cage, he explained that Meryll had asked his group to experiment on the waygates to get them working again, and this reckless experiment is what opened Alukar up to The Absence, driving him mad and on to commit these awful acts.  </p> <p>Zethe considered making the news about Meryll public, but decided there was a better use of the information. There was no gaurantee of justice if the news got out - it may end up brushed under the rug, or the will of the people swayed by some propaganda trick. Instead, she thought, she'd use the threat of the information to force Meryll to do what he should have been doing all along - helping the people.</p>"},{"location":"Characters/Zethe/#the-new-waygate-and-the-fae","title":"The New Waygate and The Fae","text":"<p>With the threat of The Absence banished for now, Zethe began to look forward to working on her 'gate' project using her Compression rune. Working with Circle and Filigree and Ebriham, they learned that they would need a large amount of cold iron, the compression rune, and a oakheart seed - a Fae artifact that allows the First World to grow. More information was needed, and Zethe travelled to the Mage College to gather more information. However, she found it locked, and it was only when the librarian Fatima let her in that she found that the archmage Seraphina had gone missing and the college was in lockdown. With a lot of persuasion, and destroying Cornelius's antimated statue, Zethe managed to persuade the tower to let her in to help. Investigating Seraphina's room, she found that Seraphina had been investigating the Fae, and that her scrying fountain had a cracked corner with a smudged 'L' written nearby. With these threads in mind, and the need for an Oakheart Seed, Zethe began to prepare for a journey to the Fae.</p> <p>Before setting off, Luna, Celeste, Elliopeth, and Regalis were given a letter from Ebriham to deliver to Master Craddis in LearHyme - payment for a mysterious mess that Luna and Celeste caused in Asgard years ago. Filigree, Zethe, Letisha, and Wilt began to pack their bags to head to Fae, but not before reuniting with Altair who had returned from [[Falcon's Hollow]] on a quest. He was curious to see what Zethe was up to, and so tagged along. Before departing, Zethe was reminded of her time in Pilgrim's Hollow, and news of the witch [[Meagra]].</p> <p>Setting off from the distant village of West Listings, Wilt agreed to lead the way - being a faeling himself, he knew the way to navigate the great forest. A kobold, Figit, from West Listings snuck in with the group, much to his mistake, as they were almost immediately assaulted by dryads who claimed they worked under Winterleaf, the Great Oak of the Grove. In the combat, Jarah called on Zethe to draw forth her power to compress timelines, and in doing so, she pulled through another version of herself - a most bestial version who she instrinsicly knew had been twisted by Meagra. While they managed to defend themselves from the assault, the party was split, and being split in the Fae is an excellent way to get lost. Zethe was left with Wilt and Figit and they had no choice but to press onwards.</p> <p>Eventually, stumbling through the Evening Grove, the group encountered a twisted monster - a monster Zethe realised used to be the Dryad Queen she had met in Pilgrim's Hollow, now twisted by Meagra as punishment for the diplomacy. While they managed to defeat the beast, she was shaken by what she saw, especially at the realisation that her partner may be at the mercy of the witch. With renewed frenzy, she pressed deeper into the forest onto to find a twisted briar - into which Altair was being dragged. She fought off the brownie and tooth fairies within and managed to drag out Altair before he was sacrificed. Without sign of Filigree or Letisha, she barely listened to Wilt as he explained he likely had a useful ally - the wizard Merryweather, who isn't allied with Meagra and may be able to help. Despite her frustrations, she did see reason and went with him to Merryweather's gnome village, alongside the injured Altair and anxious Figit. At this peaceful grove, Merryweather explained that the Faelings were beginning to grow tired of their plane shrinking as society grew - and now they wanted to expand and take back the land they viewed as theirs. </p> <p>Before they could discuss further, a dryad queen and her servants - all who belonged to Winterleaf's Grove - coverged upon the village with malicious intent. In her anger, Zethe used flames against the trees, and while effective, also secured animosity with Merryweather. Despite this, they incapacitated the advancing dryads and made a deal with the queen that she would guide them to Winterleaf's grove in exchange for her and her saplings' lives. While Zethe wasn't one to take lives unnecisarily, her current ire left a bitter sting to her words as she agreed to the terms. Within Winterleaf's Grove, she saw Filigree and Letisha bound by vines and branches to the side of a large clearing, in which stood a massive ent weilding a sword of ice. He turned to the group and greeted them cordially, immediately offering an exchange of hostages, which Zethe readily agreed to. Despite this, Winterleaf explained that he could not simply let her go, as Zethe was a threat to the Fae that Meagra needed dead, and it was on his honour that he would see the Fae protected. Despite their protestations, they agreed to a duel - if he won, Zethe would giver herself over to Meagra, and if she won, Winterleaf would let them go.</p> <p>The duel was exhausting and came very close to a loss for Zethe, with a single blow between victory and defeat. Regardless, he laid down his weapons to make good on his deal, but as he did so, a woolen doll in a mage's outfit emerged from the forest and spoke in the voice of Meagra - commanding her followers to give chase. The party ran through the Fae, desperate for a way out - which eventually presented itself in the form of a cliff. As they neared the edge, they saw eagle-riding gripplis emerge from the clouds to rescue the group. They jumped on the back of them and flew to the grippli village, and home of Udu, Awaenasal Tu-Dalv. The grippli of the village explained they were followers of The Great Eagle - another form of Breithmaehut - and The Wanderer, an [[Agathion]]. They explained that they're not allies of Meagra, and that they were sent to help Zethe after her battle - though they've been experiencing issues themselves; a child, Tche-Tsich, had gone missing from the ponds. The spiritual leaders of the Awaenasal Tu-Dalv, Tchi-Oluma, Qtchanitchl, and Kwantolgupadi, were thankful towards Zethe when she agreed to help. </p> <p>Investigating further into the ponds, Zethe, Filigree, and Tchi-Oluma found that a hollow had become far deeper than it ever was, and as they delved deeper, they found the rock type changed in a singular straight divide. The 'deeper' rock was similar to the same type found near the mountains south of Petragenis, and as they delved further, they discovered a divergence in the path. The first route took them to a young linnorm which had torn apart the doll of a kobold; Zethe had no choice but to kill the creature, as its regeneration meant that it wouldn't cease until slain by cold iron. The kobold puppet had a gem in its mouth, which she identified as a hag's eye - something that Meagre could see through. It looked as if the back of this cave had collapsed, and so they made their way down to the other path, only to find a group of more 'primative' looking kobolds holding Tche-Tsich hostage. Figit acted as translator, and they explained that they'd suddenly found themselves transported from one point in the Fae to here, and they just wanted to be home - though they hoped sacrificing the grippli would do that. Zethe ensured the child wasn't harmed, but also didn't want to kill the kobolds as it was obvious they were scared. </p> <p>Speaking with Qtchanitchl - who had taken a liking to Altair's scarf - she explained that Awaenasal Tu-Dalv used to be connected with the Valley of the Linnorm, and that it was the combined powers of The Wanderer and The Great Eagle that managed to divide the Fae and save the grippli from the proto-dragons. As they discussed history, Kwantolgupadi - the Tsu-Dan - flew in on his eagle to announce that an egg had been stolen, and they must retrieve it. Zethe took flight and swooped down towards the nests, finding the same mage-like puppet with an egg within its grasp. The fight was quick and the egg was saved, but instead of allowing the Tsu-Dan to execute the criminal, the godspawn plucked a powerful diamond hag's eye from the mouth of the puppet. This act seemed to restore the creature's will, and it thanked Zethe for saving it, but it didn't know who it was. It was then that Filigree noticed Seraphina's magical signature attached to the spellbook the puppet carried on its belt; upon further inspection, it seemed the puppet was once Seraphina - but she had been transformed by Meagra. As the grippli considered what sort of justice to mete out on the poppet, Zethe began to work on solving the kobold problem whilst trying to appeal for Seraphina's innocence as she had no controll of her body. In her research and experimentation, she found it was ordered magic and cold iron that was used by The Wanderer and The Great Eagle to seperate the Fae before. Channeling an exhausting amount of her magic, she managed to pull apart the plane - once again splitting the Linnorms from the grippli. Such a feat helped improve her standing in the gripplis' eyes, and using this, she managed to persuade them to let her take Seraphina with them.</p> <p>Glad that they had at least saved part of the archmage, Zethe had two goals remaining - obtain an Oakheart Seed for the gate project, and escape the Fae. She hoped that the colleage of Asgard would be able to find help for Seraphina's memories, though the wizard herself seemed unsure that she wanted to remember her past, believing that she was once an evil person. Asking around Awaenasal Tu-Dalv, they met the elf Terruka who had journeyed from Annasidis, and explained that his homeland may be able to help - and that Meagra was trying to bind the ear of their Lord Treband. Annasidis was a huge city built on gargantuan mangroves which stood in the saltwater lagoon, and was considered one of the most civilised areas of the Fae. Zethe, Filigree, Wilt, Letisha, Altair, Seraphina, and Tchi-Oluma journeyed on the backs of the eagles to the great elven city, though Zethe made a crash landing at the feet of the elf guard Lady Dahlia, who was less than impressed. Nevertheless, the knight explained that the city was experiencing a great blight which was killing their saltwater crops and risking a famine; they also explained that Meagra's spies were lurking in the shadows of the city, and they had been trying to persuade Lord Terbond to join their cause in taking over the mortal plane. </p> <p>Deciding to get on their good side - and wanting to help the people anyway - Zethe decided to get to the bottom of the plague mystery, wondering what could have caused such a strange blight so suddenly. On investigation, it didn't seem to be a natural sickness, but rather a conductive chemical in the water. While it was uncomfortable to do so, she filled her robotic lungs up with water and sunk to the bottom of the lagoon, walking along the bottom to where the chemical became more saturated. Eventually she found a sunken ship - The Tinder Rose - which had a damaged crate of mercury within; it looked as if the crate had come from Petragenis and the ship had sailed from Ocean Point. A black pudding had formed within the ship, and in the fight she summoned another version of herself - a form that had been caught in a mudslide and buried; as the poor soul returned to their timeline, Jarah explained that their momentary absense gave some give in the mud, which would eventually allow them to escape. Using magic hauling braces found within the ship, she picked the incredibly heavy crate up from the wreck and hauled it out of the water, removing the blight. </p> <p>This deed drew the eye of Lord Trebond, who agreed to meet her in council later in the week. In the meantime, Filigree and Letisha began to work on an extraction plan for the remaining quicksilver while Zethe started crafting an extended wand of humanoid form, which she planned to give to Seraphina. As they went to The Court of the Eastern Storm, they saw a four armed, purple clad man whispering in the ear of the Lord Trebond; when it was her turn to speak, she got the hint that the lord of Annasidis wanted her to investigate Reisparalis's Horde near Jens, which had been taken over by bandits and held a very potent treasure within. The group set off through the Fae, guided by Lady Dahlia, who suggested that she was no friend of Meagra. As they breached the Fae near Jens, they were directed to Reisparalis' Horde only to find it taken over by goblins and orcs - mercinaries. They managed to fight them off, but when they entered the vault, they found the purple cloaked figure within. He was a wooden puppet who introduced himself as Collodi, and said that he was working under the direction of Meagra - and that he was going to retrieve the Oakheart here for their expansion into Asgard. They fought, and Seraphina attacked in a blistering rage, almost killing Altair in the combat. Zethe used her summoning powers again, though this time pulled forth a very malevolent Zethe - one that had been infected by Uber-Seccentium. For the few moments it was there, it teased Zethe has it slashed deep gashes into the puppetmaster, before Zethe banished it with a blast of holy fire - which also burned Collodi to ash. Before the fire could spread to the Oakheart seed, the godspawn used the rune control she had learned from Ebriham's teachings to stop the blaze from consuming the artefact. She retreived it, alongside the burned stump of Collodi's hand, and but before she could return, she was repremanded for her irrisponsible user of her magic by Breithmaehut. When pressing her for more information, the god explained she couldn't say more, but reluctantly said an explanation may be found in the ruins in Hel - the ruins that Filigree discovered. Eventually, they returned to Annaside where she presented her work to Lord Trebond. He publicly rewarded her, allowed her to keep the Oakheart seed, and secured the city as a bastion against Meagra in the Fae - for now, anyway. With that in order, they left upon the backs of the eagles and exited the Fae, returning to West Listings - two months after leaving.</p>"},{"location":"Characters/Zethe/#return-to-asgard-and-the-inbetwixt","title":"Return to Asgard and the Inbetwixt","text":"<p>Upon reaching the city, Zethe was greated by a crowd of people - including Meryll. Upon the back of a stone lion that she was gifted by Lord Trebond, she was called Lionheart by the people - a name which she secretly quite liked.

For the first time in a while, she took a day off to be with her partners. The rest condtinued into the next day, when she summoned Breithmaehut's consciousness into Alph-E and she travelled the city with her mother, with them both getting matching togas from the market. Finally, after her two days of rest, she returned to work on making the gate - studying closely with Circle, she found the cost was going to be enourmous as it needed exorbident amounts of cold iron and opal. Without standard means to finance the project, she blackmailed Meryll into revealing his dealings with Alukar unless he funded the project - believing that this was the only way he'd pay back the people for his crimes. He reluctantly agreed, and Zethe created the Oakheart Chisel from the seed, leaving her with a chaotic tool she could create god metals with using her Utopic energy.</p> <p>Before starting the Gate, she spoke one final time to the captive Alukar, who explained that the Soulless were people who were connected to the Forgotten God and whose souls were stuck outside of the cycle, unable to move on to an outer plane and being in an endless cycle of reincarnation. Considering what happened to the madman, she was worried that the Absence might try to make contact through the gate, she took precautions against its evil signature. Finally, before starting her gateway project, she offered the wand of humanoid form to Seraphina, who rejected it - wanting to remain in her new life, and to abscond from the college. Zethe agreed to share the news with the college by explaining that their archmage had spontaniously quit; the professors reluctantly agreed to accept the godling's words and let her collect Seraphina's things from her quarters. </p> <p>With all but one piece of work completed in Asgard, Zethe started her grand design and spent an entire week without sleep forging the gate with the cold iron, opal, and Oakheart Chisel; it took the form of twisting metal trees that coiled together, creating a 20ft tall by 15ft wide gate underneath the church in the lower city. The event caused great celebration in the poorer districts as she explained that the space inside was meant for them to farm in - to carve out their own lives outside the greed of the upper city. Before allowing them in, however,  she resolved to test that the Inbetwixt was safe.</p> <p>Upon entering the newly created dimension, she was greeted with a white expanse filled with breathable air and settled at a moderate temperature that stretched on for a four mile diametre. Satisfied with the results, she turned to leave, only to see a shifting figure behind her. The shape was incomprehensible, but he introduced himself as The Forgotten God, and explained that his Absense form has all but completely gripped him, but he communicated to her in true for the few moments he could. He congratulated her for her work, though sounded sorrowful throughout, and then passed on a letter to give to Breithmaehut. Even the minute or so she was in his presence left her utterly exhausted - more tired than she had ever felt - and she somehow looked gaunt as she exited the gate. Despite her exhaustion, she managed to smile and wave to the huge crowd that had gathered before leaving on the back of her stone lion. As she rested in Lady Damocles' house, she used the gavel to summon Breithmaehut to deliver the message; whatever it said, it upset the God of Order, who actually hugged Zethe for comfort, before she asked her to investigate the ruins of Hel to discover more. After their conversation, Zethe fell into the first deep sleep she had for months, and was bedbound for a couple of days afterwards.</p> <p>Using the wand of humanoid form on herself, she celebrated with her close friends from Asgard, enjoying the night as a human before preparing to set off the next day. Letisha asked if she could stay in the city alongside Wilt to help with the farming in the Inbetwixt before she wanted to head back to LaerHyme to learn more of healing elixirs to help more people. Altair and Seraphina, on the other hand, wanted to journey to Hel with Zethe, Celeste, and Filigree. As they left the city, Zethe was followed by a large mob of people who seemed inspired by her actions, as well as reverant; she was uncomfortable with the idea, but wanted to at least share a positive message of peace and love before she left - though she had no clue how it would be actually taken...</p>"},{"location":"Characters/celeste/","title":"Celeste","text":""},{"location":"Characters/celeste/#summary","title":"summary","text":"<ul> <li>known associates: Zethe Wayright </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Characters/strumrock%20kowl/","title":"Strumrock kowl","text":""},{"location":"Characters/strumrock%20kowl/#description","title":"Description","text":"<p>svirfneblin wizard/inventor although of gnomish decent they're about 5 ft tall due to thier mechanical legs replacements for an accident in their past.

As they were creatures who came into being as concepts of an \u2018order\u2019 that did not yet truly exist, they fought against their contradictory nature by creating said order. Initially starting small, they enforced the law of gravity, coalescing motes of dust that floated in the void until it was an expansive planet. Not content with an expanse of empty dirt, they transformed the latent chaotic matter around them into shelters which rapidly transformed from shacks to grand structures as the increase in order fed the equations which enforced it. With a city created, they deemed it necessary to inhabit it, and thus enforced the laws of society, filling it with new axiomites. Finally, once this perfect city had been created, the Fundamental Axiomites - those of physics, outsider society, magic, and planes - enforced their final law, that being that their laws should be upheld. Working together, they created a gargantuan golem out of the remaining latent entropy that had once surrounded their new eternal city; a towering orb of marble and metal that could protect and enforce the Fundamental Laws, and they called it Breithmaehut. </p> <p>Breithmaehut was the first Inevitable, and the inspiration of the creation of those outsiders. Initially they were created for protection of the fundamentals as a lesser Primal God - a divine golem without thought, emotion, or any desire other than its assigned duty. For millions of years it stayed that way - stoically weathering the assaults against reality from Diatarachtos and its Proteans. This Primal form, Breithmaehut M. I, took the form of a huge orb with a single lense for the Fundamental Axiomatics to peer out from. As the Protean threat developed, and the agents of Chaos swelled in size and variety, the forms of Breithmaehut too evolved. Developments like the M. III centaur-like construction, or the more humanoid cloaked M. IV golem helped secure a stable reality for the development of the universe at large. </p> <p>Upon the birth of the Forgotten God - the God of Mortal Ascension, and the first pure Mortal God - the fate of the Inexorable Truth would change permanently. The Lost God, the father of Pesmaenos and Iroas, believed that society had to develop for mortals to prosper, and no longer could they be left to dwell in caves or burrows to be picked off by monsters. In order to achieve his lofty goals, he first created a powerful spell - a legendary version of an enchantment used even today - Awaken. With this newly forged power, He cast it upon the mindless Breithmaehut M. V and granted it a consciousness. Initially confused at its state, it began to learn with The Lost God, and of his plans to uplift society and the help he needed. Breithmaehut M. V made their first decision, and rebuilt herself into Breithmaehut M. VI - the current form of the God of Law. </p> <p>They proved an invaluable ally to the Lost God, safeguarding societal development from outside influence and using the souls of lawful mortals to create new Axiomites and Inevitables to continue to protect the evolution of mortalkind from Chaotic influence. Initially struggling with their new mind, as society developed and under the guidance of the Forgotten God, they developed a will and personality of their own - fully transitioning from a Primal God to a Mortal God. </p> <p>It has been theorised by scholars that, had Pesmaenos not committed the Great Blasphemy, Breithmaehut and the Forgotten God would have steered societies all over Omnia into a state of moral perfection. Others argue that the land would be left a uniform and conformist greyscape, devoid of passion or individuality. Whatever the case may have been, it's not for us to know, as the Forgotten God was slain by his own son, and it was Breithmaehut and Iroas who brought the Betrayer to justice.</p> <p>\"At first, consciousness was a curse.

The Forgemaster would bring his peerless skill and craftsmanship, forging the prison out of pure power. Within these foundations, the words of Breithmaehut. Infallible logic, forged into the prison so that it\u2019s mere existence would become an immutable truth of creation. To counteract the everchanging nature of Ilberalis, Tantalos would lend his very essence; Chaos incarnate. They knew He could not be destroyed, so imprisonment was the only recourse.

Books can be taken from the Library, in fact you\u2019ll see a lot of familiars and lesser creatures collecting and taking out books for their Masters.</p> <p>Kat\u00e1lixi created Bookkeepers to help run and maintain the Library, they run all mundane tasks such as helping visitors to the Library and visitors must always be accompanied by a Bookkeeper. Bookkeepers are created from the souls of those that end up at the Library after dying and are given the choice to become Bookkeepers or to fade, they keep their appearance from life and much of their personality, though the more extreme souls are filtered out.</p> <p>The Library contains the Past and Present of all things and that includes the people and creatures of Omnia but Kat\u00e1lixi at the request of the Lesser God Vigil put them in charge of these books as they needed access to them to fulfil their role.</p> <p>Depictions of Kat\u00e1lixi vary depending on who you ask, as Kat\u00e1lixi takes many forms but all seem to be characters from the vast stories in the Library, usually taking the form of a character from a book said person has read before. Though the true form of this God is still one that is unknown.</p>"},{"location":"Gods%20and%20Outsiders/Lyvathean/","title":"Lyvathean","text":""},{"location":"Gods%20and%20Outsiders/Lyvathean/#titles","title":"Titles","text":"<ul> <li>The Eater</li> <li>Obliteration</li> <li></li> </ul>"},{"location":"Gods%20and%20Outsiders/Nameless%20Hero/","title":"Nameless Hero","text":""},{"location":"Gods%20and%20Outsiders/Nameless%20Hero/#alignment","title":"Alignment","text":"<p>LN, but will work well with LG in most circumstances - though do not show pity when it interferes with their duty.

In order to achieve optimal results, they expanded the Council of V\u0305I\u0305 to many times its original size, adding new variations of themselves in order to find the correct path. </p> <p>It was in these variations that Uber-Seccentium was created. Within the Council, they suggested that the most logical solution was to uplift mortals in this time of prosperity to be one with Order, thus forever defeating Chaos and creating the perfect world. The argument, at first, went uncontested. More traditional members pushed back, declaring that more caution was needed before committing to such a drastic action. Despite their protests, the majority of the Council sided with the new variation and attempted to pass the motion, declaring that such an optimal time may not come again, despite a lack of consensus. Such a bold move was not taken well by the traditional variations for a multitude of reasons - not least the deviations' blatant disregard for 'proper procedure'. Regardless, the Council's hand was forced to act, and a corrupting message seeped from the mind of Breithmaehut into Utopia. </p> <p>Using what power they could muster, the Godmind sealed off their consciousness from the outside world to try stem the deviations' influence, cutting themselves off from mortal prayer as well. They waged war inside of their own shell for over a century, whilst the corrupted inevitables and axiomites spread the deviations' message inside of the 'perfect city'. Machine, maths, and unfortunate mortal visitors were combined into one - monstrous amalgamations of flesh, machine, and logic with their minds totally replaced by the deviations' will. </p> <p>It was through this method of \u201cperfection\u201d that Breithmaehut found a method to purge this blight. The realm of Utopia is one purely in the outer planes, such a concentration of mortal flesh causes a pull towards the material plane. Breithmaehut used this effect to separate the followers of the deviation into a sub pocket and cast them from the main body of Utopia hopefully to their eventual demise in the void.

They sailed the treacherous seas in the name of justice, hunting down pirates, sea monsters, and all manner of evil that threatened the coastal cities. Their flagship, the Sable Serpent, was a symbol of hope and valor, known to all who dwelled by the sea.</p> <p>The Curse</p> <p>During one of their voyages, the Forsaken Fleet came upon a mysterious island shrouded in perpetual fog. The island was rumored to be the resting place of an ancient and powerful artifact known as the Heart of Dread, a gem said to grant immortality at a terrible cost. Unbeknownst to Captain Darkmoor, the artifact was cursed by a vengeful sea witch who sought to trap the souls of all who dared to claim it.Driven by greed and the promise of eternal life, the crew disobeyed their captain\u2019s warnings and seized the Heart of Dread. The moment they touched the gem, a powerful curse was unleashed, transforming the once-noble crew into monstrous, flesh-eating ghouls. Their bodies decayed, and their minds twisted with insatiable hunger, yet they were bound to the island, unable to leave its shores.</p> <p>The Eternal Feast</p> <p>The curse did not stop at mere transformation. The Forsaken Fleet's hunger could only be sated by the flesh of the living. Over the centuries, the island became known as the Isle of Shadows, and stories of the flesh-eating ghouls kept sailors far away. However, every so often, a shipwreck or an unwary traveler would land on the island, only to become the next meal for the cursed crew.Captain Darkmoor, now a ghoul lord, retained a semblance of his former self and sought a way to break the curse. He delved into forbidden lore, hoping to find a way to free his men and himself from their eternal damnation. Despite his efforts, the curse's grip only tightened, and the Heart of Dread remained unyielding in its dark power.</p> <p>Rise of the Flesh-Eating Courts</p> <p>In recent times, whispers of a powerful necromancer reaching the Isle of Shadows began to spread. This necromancer, drawn by the dark power of the Heart of Dread, struck a bargain with Captain Darkmoor. In exchange for aiding the necromancer's conquests, the captain and his crew would be given dominion over the seas once more, their hunger used as a weapon against their enemies.Thus, the Forsaken Fleet became the Flesh-Eating Courts, an undead army that rises from the depths to terrorize the living. They are led by Captain Darkmoor, whose undying determination to lift the curse drives them forward. Their ships, spectral and rotting, sail under the cover of night, and their ghastly forms strike fear into the hearts of all who dare to cross their path.</p> <p>The Endless Quest</p> <p>Captain Darkmoor and his Flesh-Eating Courts now scour the seas and the coastal lands, seeking powerful artifacts and ancient magic that might finally break their curse.

They were not incorrect to believe that Asgard were hoping to expand; it was the King's wish to begin a large war for the glory of his city, and to claim the land that was rightfully his. </p> <p>Starting small, General Rizzat began to muster Asgard's martial forces, rallying the populace to look to the glory days of the Utopic Warriors. Weapons and armour were forged and troops trained, but Rizzat found his army lacking. Surely enough to beat any neighbouring state individually, but not without sustaining strong losses - and not to mention if they were to ally against his city. He shared his conerns with King Sultraz, who did not take kindly to his general's lack of faith. </p> <p>King Sultraz, like Asgard's royalty before him, was of the mind that his rule - and the superiority of his city - was ordained by divine right. To question his might was to question the will of Breithmaehut, and when Rizzat suggested that they would not be able to create an army capable of conquoring Omnia, Sultraz nearly had him executed. However, the general had been a good friend and advisor to him - and not to mention, he had proven his military prowess when defending the city against a better equipped wave of Druegar who had attempted to enslave the Dredd Corner in a midnight coup known as the 'Deep Rising'. As obstinent as he could be, General Rizzat knew what he was doing, and his judgement was likely correct. </p> <p>But that did not put King Sultraz's desires to rest. The conquest would happen, even if they needed to be a bit more imaginative to achieve it, and he put his general to work in discovering how. Rizzat took the challenge, and laid out the problems he would face. The first was, with Asgard being a walled city, they didn't have the manpower to create an army that could replenish itself after a large loss. The second was that their wizards were both disobedient and underfunded; it was no secret that most government funding in the magical arts went to the Hall of Justice - Breithmaehut's church - and the arcane mages were operating on a shoe string budget with little love for the king. The third was that their neighbours had already shown signs of allying against them - the Linthumveil Alliance was likely only the start, and it would not surprise him if they would be willing to unit the entire south against them, and not to mention the threat of Hel attacking should they show weakness. Finally, even should these problems be overcome, there were still considerable logistical issues when it came to food, water, and transport. </p> <p>These problems troubled General Rizzat for some time, and with each day the King's patience grew shorter. It was in prayer that his troubles were answered - well, when thinking of the concept of prayer, anyway. The Hall of Justice was a very well funded public building because it provided food, water, sanitation, curatives, and order to Asgard - it was totally indispensible, but perhaps held the power to solve his struggle. He visited High Officiate Ordinos and explained his troubles - while the church was no military power, perhaps they could provide his soldiers with healing, food, magical support, and missionary work to unaligned neighbours. They would not need a great deal of clerics, but their help could tip the balance of power in their favour.</p> <p>High Officiate Ordinos had other ideas. Not that he disagreed with the general's plees, but rather he thought he could go further. Indeed, the grand cleric suggested sending a select number of the church's champions to war as a crusading force. The Officiate's words surprised the general - surely the church wouldn't be willing to give up its members? Powerful casters they may be, they hadn't seen war before and would likely be torn apart without trained soldiers to assist them; not to mention the total lack of numbers. Again, Ordinos didn't seem turned by Rizzat's concerns - in fact, he met the general's worried gaze with a knowing smirk. You see, the clergyman explained, he didn't need numbers - he had the power of the divine on his side, and this was ingeminated by a gift he had recently received. </p> <p>General Rizzat was shown into a personal meeting room, where he saw a large chunk of white marble in the centre of a clean table, streaked with glowing blue veins. It was, Ordinos explained, the flesh of Breithmaehut, which was delivered to him through a twin-tailed comet that halted its arc in front of him on one of his medative walks around the gardens. What's more - he had been visited in dreams by his god, who had commanded him to imbue her flesh into armour. The general was unnerved by the priest, whose eyes seemed to gleam with some incideous madness, but his tactical mind told him to continue listening. Without objections present, the High Officiate went on to explain that the Divine Flesh would give the wearers of the armour incredible power - enhanced strength, incredible reactions, unstoppable regeneration, and lightning enfused into their veins. All the Hall of Justice needed was a reason - and the permission of the King, of course.</p> <p>King Sultraz met the report with mixed feelings. On one hand, such divine providence suggested that his visions of conquest may be possible. On the other hand, it would be in the church's name and not his. Divinely ordained or not, he didn't want any clerics getting any ideas of a coup on their minds. As such, he held a meeting with General Rizzat, himself, and High Officiate Ordinos to discuss the project; no one is certain exactly what was said in that room, but the agreement that came out of it was to be written down in Asgard's history. </p> <p>The Godforged Contract was created as an amalgamation between the Hall of Justice, the Army of Asgard, and the Royal Treasury. Soon after, the forgework began. The trained soldiers began to impart their knowledge to the chosen members of the clergy, the king pumped money into the hiring of master craftsmen who were aided by axiomites summoned by the church. It was soon found that this 'Divine Flesh' did not deplete no matter how many shards were taken and infused into the armour, which took on a bright gold colouration when infused. </p> <p>Within six months, the armour was forged and the basic lessons of combat had been imparted onto the faithful. It was time for those Officiates who had proven themselves in the past months to reap their reward in the form of magnificent suits of full plate. When they donned their new equipment, the wearers immediately found their victuals enhanced and their nerves energised - but this sensation was quickly overshadowed by a strange tingling in their dominant forearms. To those on the outside, they saw a gauntlet take the form of the Divine Flesh - white stone inlaid with lightning blue veins. These clerics soon found that they couldn't remove these parts of the armour, though they took this as a symbol of their faith.</p> <p>Soon, The Godforged grew in numbers, which included the devout Grand Officiate and his most trusted companion, Officiate Ebriham. As their numbers grew in the city, the first of their order began their long march, celebrated by the city as the start of a new year blessed by the gods. </p> <p>General Rizzet watched these towering golden men of iron leave Asgard's walls; he was shocked by their overwealming strength. He was stunned by their sudden mastery of weaponry. He was in awe at their abandonment of mortal weakness. </p> <p>He was horrified at what they had become.</p>"},{"location":"Groups/The%20Godforged/#campaign","title":"Campaign","text":"<p>--- Campaign lore to be inserted ---</p>"},{"location":"Groups/The%20Godforged/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>The Godforged are a legion of clerics of Breithmaehut who had forged their armour with Divine Flesh, which turned them into superhuman warriors of order infused with lightning.

Citizens had been tormented by unnatural wailing carried on the waters in the dead of night, and fishing boats had washed up vacant, devoid of both crew and cargo. Seeing this as an opportunity to test their newfound strength, the newly formed Godforged were dispatched to investigate the issue. </p> <p>When they arrived, they found Adiseigo beset by ghouls. The citizens had locked themselves into their houses, but their wooden walls wouldn't last long under assault. Worse still, the undead had brought forth a rotting winged beast with claws sharp enough to slice through Breithmaetite and a screech potent enough to rupture organs. The monster had taken to peeling apart houses to let the ghouls flood in, but that quickly stopped as they noticed the encroaching Godforged. With an ear piercing shriek, the undead surged forward and met divine steel with necromantically enhanced claws. </p> <p>Paladin and ghoul were torn asunder as the clash reached its apex, but as Knight Ebriham marched to meet the Abhorrent King atop his monstrous mount, another roar echoed through the stricken town. Skimming the sea mist, four massive dragons flew ashore, immediately wreaking havoc on the buildings beneath them. With a harsh laugh at the new challenge, the Ghoul King forced his mount to take flight and clash with an encroaching blue dragon in midair; the two beasts scrambled with one another until the undead monster broke free, tearing a huge chunk of the blue dragon's neck off along with it. Before it could escape and regain its strength, the wyrm gave chase, seemingly unbothered by the gaping wound, and tore through the undead monstrosity.</p> <p>On the ground, ghoul and Godforged looked to one another and understood - the only way they would survive is by joining forces against the oncoming threat. Paladins held the line as a gargantuan red dragon charged through the town square; the undead tore at its scales whilst the knights stabbed at its underbelly. Ebriham moved to challenge the dragon, sword in hand and heart pounding in his chest; his augmented body was strong, yes, but still no match for the ancient wyrm. The beast narrowed its eyes and seemed to smirk as the oncoming challenge, knowing full well this mortal could do little more than scratch its hide. Sword blow after sword blow, the monster remained unfazed; occasionally it clawed back, but more akin to the way a cat toys with a cornered mouse. While his armour allowed him to keep his vigor - its white metal knitting together his wounds - he knew it was only a matter of time before the dragon stopped playing with its food. It was at that point a terrible roar commanded the attention of the battlefield, and the red wyrm turned its head to see its blue companion overwhelmed by ghoul and paladin alike, injured and forced to retreat. Its indignant shock provided Ebriham the perfect opportunity to stab his blade into the beast's eye; it reeled backwards before taking off, leaving the seaside town and fleeing across the waves once again\u2026</p> <p>Game 1 - Sons of Drakkon</p> <p>White hot pain. Khalgorak the fervor let out a Bellow of indignation. How dare this... this... this MORTAL leave a single scratch on his resplendent body. Clawing desperately into the air like a cat struggling to find purchase on a sodden wall Khalgorak could see his foremost General, Nithicin the Storm, laid low ghouls overrunning her body. With a bath of flame he cleared the pests pulling her body to safety.  This had not been the victory he had sought, mortals seemingly had some tricks that he was not used to, the necromantic arts for one had advanced considerably since his time how dare they descrate his kin they would burn for this. Then there was those armoured warriors. That armour... He glanced back at the figure in marble and gold, his one good eye burning with rage. The figure looked back, resolve in his eyes. Yes all would burn Especially THAT one!</p> <p>Game 1 - The Forsaken Fleet</p> <p>As the crimson dawn broke over the battered settlement of Adiseigo, Captain Darkmoor stood atop the crumbling remnants of a shattered house, surveying the aftermath. The scent of blood hung thick in the air, mingling with the acrid stench of charred wood. His ghouls, their ghastly forms still trembling with the aftershocks of battle, gathered around him, their hunger momentarily sated by the flesh of the fallen.</p> <p>The battle had been fierce, and the alliance with the Godforged, however fleeting, had been unexpected. Darkmoor\u2019s mind raced, replaying the clash of steel and claw, the roars of dragons, and the desperate cries of mortals. His mount, the monstrous beast that had been torn asunder by the blue dragon, lay in ruins, a testament to the ferocity of their adversaries.</p> <p>Despite the victory over the dragons, Darkmoor felt a pang of frustration. The Heart of Dread\u2019s curse weighed heavily upon him, its dark whispers gnawing at the edges of his sanity. The necromancer\u2019s promise had brought them this far, but the path to true freedom remained elusive.</p> <p>\u201cGather the remains,\u201d he commanded, his voice a guttural growl that echoed through the stillness. His ghouls obeyed, scavenging the battlefield for any remnants of their foes and allies alike. Flesh was precious, and their hunger insatiable.</p> <p>As his minions worked, Darkmoor turned his gaze to the horizon. The dragons had retreated, their arrogance shattered by the combined might of ghoul and paladin. But he knew they would return. The ancient wyrms were not so easily defeated, and their thirst for vengeance would drive them back to Adiseigo.</p> <p>\u201cCaptain,\u201d a voice rasped from behind him. It was Thorne, his loyal first mate, now a ghoul knight twisted by the curse yet retaining a semblance of his former self. \u201cWhat are our orders?\u201d</p> <p>Darkmoor clenched his decayed fists, the hunger gnawing at his insides. \u201cWe prepare,\u201d he said, his voice resolute. \u201cThe dragons will come again, and when they do, we shall be ready. But more than that, we must seek out the necromancer. His power is our key to breaking this curse.\u201d</p> <p>Thorne nodded, his eyes gleaming with a malevolent hunger. \u201cAnd the Godforged?\u201d</p> <p>A twisted smile crept across Darkmoor\u2019s face. \u201cThey were worthy allies today, but do not mistake them for friends. When the time comes, we will feast on their flesh as well. For now, let them think they have won a respite. It will make their downfall all the sweeter.\u201d</p> <p>The ghoul lord cast one last glance at the ruins of Adiseigo. The settlement had withstood the onslaught, but it was a hollow victory. The true battle lay ahead, in the depths of forbidden lore and the dark pacts yet to be forged.</p> <p>\u201cLet the tale of the Forsaken Fleet spread,\u201d he murmured, more to himself than to his men. \u201cLet them fear the night, and the shadows that dwell within it. We are the Flesh-Eating Courts, and we shall not rest until our hunger is sated, and our curse lifted.\u201d</p> <p>With that, Captain Darkmoor descended from his perch, his tattered cloak billowing in the breeze. The ghouls followed, a spectral procession of death and decay, as they melted back into the mists from whence they came. The seas would be their hunting grounds, and the coastal cities their feasting halls.</p> <p>The endless quest continued, driven by hunger, hatred, and a glimmer of hope that one day, the Forsaken Fleet might sail free once more.</p> <p>Game 1 - The Godforged</p> <p>The men and women of the Godsworn dragged themselves up off the bloodsoaked ground as the dragons and ghouls left. Adiseigo was scarred, but still mostly intact, with the majority of its population alive. Grievous wounds had been healed by the white metal - even replacing lost limbs and organs; the potency of the regeneration was so great that all who fell in battle were able to return home to their families the next day.</p> <p>Though, the people who returned were not necessarily the same as those who left\u2026</p>"},{"location":"History/the%20Age%20of%20Gold/","title":"the Age of Gold","text":"<ul> <li>Known as an age of prosperity and advancement this saw the creation and discovery of many things such as mortals discovery of arcane magic. </li> <li>Commonly associated with The Forgotten God</li> <li>Probably spanned many \"ages\" by historical accounts</li> </ul>"},{"location":"History/Past%20Games/Abyss%20Watch/","title":"Abyss Watch","text":"<p>The Abyss Watch of Greywall journeyed deep into the Wastes to Westwatch to try and reclaim High Praetor, Hrothgan Warforge - Grand Inheritor of Iroas's Bloodline. </p> <p>The Westwatch had been beset by powerful demons, led by Zeripheze, the Winged Death.

Falcon's Hollow itself was a rundown town ruled by the iron fist of the Kreed family and their lackeys.  </p> <p>Setting off into the veil, they came across an ancient ruin of a temple of Iroas, which had become the house of the Truescale kobolds - alongside the Darkmoon Beast. Making a deal with Greypelt, they ventured deeper in and discovered a kobold Warren which was ruled by King Meroklep. The Truescale kobolds had recently been attacked by a wizard who had rampaged through their Warren to search deeper - Drazmorg, a wizard expelled from Leirhyme due to 'unethical use of magic'. In his violent search, he accidentally unearthed the Crown of Domination which was quickly stolen by Meroklep, who ventured in after him. After the party scared off the remaining Truescales, they learned the place was now called Droskar's Crucible, and that it was once an Iroan Cult who lost their way to a mysterious entity called Droskar. Droskar was a manifestation of Hallowhusk, the Siktempora of Blasphemy, born from the divine emotional caused by the slaying of the Forgotten God, who strives to twist divine intent and drive the holy to blaspheme. </p> <p>Drazmorg had discovered a seal deeper within the Crucible, which he overloaded with magic. Doing so caused the already aged and damages seal to shatter, weakening the Iroan-forged locks that once bound the Siktempora from the material plane. The energy raised the dead and began funneling into Meroklep's crown, empowering the Kobold King.</p> <p>The party eventually discovered Drazmorg and put an end to him, though found the seal utterly beyond repair. Regardless of the wizard's defeat, the Kobold King Meroklep was still receiving the ambient power into the crown, and so they ventured to the final level of the Crucible to put an end to the king. Upon slaying Meroklep and destroying the crown, the resonant energy of the seal was free to  cling to the martial plane - weakening the gap between it and the Astral Plane where the Siktempora form. </p> <p>Upon returning to Falcon's Hollow, the team took to launching an assault on the Kreed household after stirring up rebellion with a ruse of using Waylen's demon as a false manifestation of the Kreed's evil. After fighting through their remaining loyal guards, they came across Thuldrin Kreed, who accidentally manifested the physical embodiment of the Misery his family had created - a powerful Siktempora. While the party did slay it, it's likely only the beginning of the troubles Omnia will face from the weakened planar barrier.</p> <p>Epilogue Waylen After defeating the Kreed family, Waylen staged the defeat of his Demon by his own hands, securing his place in the hearts of the people. Seen as a benevolent leader, he was supported as the new ruler of Falcon's Hollow. Of course, while he needs to keep up his pretense of 'Holy Saviour' on the surface, he's very happy to engage in backroom dealings with benefactors, including pirates. </p> <p>Despite his dark ties and greed, Waylen is a much 'kinder' ruler than the ones before him, and only a very select few know otherwise. </p> <p>Nori Taking a large chunk of the wealth that once belonged to the Kreed family with him, Nori returned to his crew alongside Cal - victorious and rich. With such a large bounty and increased magical aptitude, the crew's respect for Nori was at an all time high. Enough that he could suggest the next raids and adventurers to the captain and they'd actually be likely to listen. Wherever the crew left a port, a new song telling of their daring deeds was sure to ring through the docks for months afterwards. </p> <p>While his adventures at sea have only just started anew, he did make an odd request (backed by his new wealth) to return to Ocean Point\u2026</p> <p>Cal Cal initially joined with Nori on the ship, alongside their tremendous wealth. But she knew that despite her skills as a pirate, it wasn't the life for her - not when Ocean Point was still under the grip of a mysterious cult. Despite her adventures, she was still technically the prisoner of the crew, and while she could probably fight her way through them, she opted for a more peaceful solution working alongside Nori. </p> <p>Nori persuaded the captain to head to Ocean Point, and while there, Cal faked her own dead and fled the port. Now she seeks more information about the Cult that's rotting her home from the inside - and with her newfound power, she can make some real waves in Ocean Point. </p> <p>Altair Content with the heroism and style he had brought to the dreary Falcon's Hollow, Altair decided to take his leave from the town and pursue the cracked seal - and perhaps a way to repair it. Deciding the best place to learn of ancient magic, he headed onwards to Laerhyme, and then to Asguard to learn of the power the old high priest used to maintain the seal. </p> <p>Whatever answers he may find, Altair's journey to stop the Siktempora is just beginning - and it's likely to lead into more peril than he's ever known before. Of course, that will be no problem for the leading man! </p>"},{"location":"Places/Asgard/","title":"Asgard","text":"<p>![[Asgardsketch.png|400]]</p>"},{"location":"Places/Asgard/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>Asgard is the largest city on the overground of Omnia by population. Situated in the Sea of Bones - a desert nicknamed for the amount of people who died in the area during the Cataclysm - this huge walled metropolis has stood strong as a bastion against chaos since it was erected. Its walls were built in haste as the mutagenic mist of Cataclysm spread quickly southwards by soneshapers, and they fit as many people as they could account for inside, closing itself off from the rest of the world. The selection process for the survivors is a sore point in the city\u2019s history, as they chose based on their abilities to rebuild civilization, leaving many innocents out to face their grizzly fate. Initially just a crude barrier shaped from a nearby mountain range around an oasis, the surviving citizens began to build back their lives, using the skills they were selected for to do so.      In the current day, Asgard posits itself as the centre of civilisation - a beacon for all other cultures to aspire to. It draws its waters from the mountains the walls were built from using an impressive aqueduct that brings liquid throughout the entire city through canals. While the most common religion in Asgard is Breithmaeism, a wide variety of faiths are practised within the city, and its culture is surprisingly varied.      The city is divided into the upper and lower sections. The lower city is the original city, and now plays home to the slums, and countless people who must work in gruelling  workhouses to make their way. Ethical protocol dictated that the slums needed access to an \u2018adequate\u2019 amount of sunlight, and so huge craters were built into the upper city to provide the mercy of day to the slums. The upper city was built on top after the Cataclysm (during the start of the Age of Reclamation), as the city required more space but couldn\u2019t build outwards due to the walls; as such, they built upwards. While it did not start with the intention of separating out social classes, land on the upper city quickly became only affordable to those with a large amount of means. </p>"},{"location":"Places/Asgard/#details-and-facts","title":"Details and facts","text":"<ul> <li>The walls proper of Asgard cover an area of 160 acres this is about 650,000 sqm (0.65 sqkm).

While the Feywild is considered a \u201cBase\u201d plane, it somehow exists behind both the Material and Shadow plane.</p> <p>The reason people believe the Feywild to be unfinished is due to its lack of fixed universal laws of physics, gravity is inconsistent and time is unreliable, just to name a few. The Feywild is an infinite plane of constantly varying wilderness, as if the wilderness itself is alive. Conditions vary dramatically from place to place, what would be considered to be laws of nature on the Material Plane are no more than local by-laws in the Feywild, and even these by-laws can be overturned (even unconsciously) by those with sufficient willpower. Times and distances are unreliable in the Feywild. Areas of stability do exist but do not last long in the ever changing environment.</p> <p>There are areas in the Material, Shadow and Feywild where all planes come close, in these areas each plane's influence seeps into the other affecting the area around it. In the Material Plane these areas are generally wild places far from civilization, often marked by mounds, stones, or rings of earth or mushrooms and are inhabited by minor Fey, like Sprites. Folk tales tell of people accidentally wandering into these areas only to end up in the Feywild or getting tricked by the more tricky Fey into stepping through. No beings rule the Feywild, but its most powerful beings are called Arch Fey. Each is equally mysterious and cares less for lesser beings, unless they pique their interest but all command great respect or fear from the other inhabitants of the Feywild, being similar in power to Planar Exemplars they also have the power to bestow power to those they deem interesting. Soul Cycle</p> <p>The Feywilds connection to the Soul Cycle is complicated to say the least, to say it has no connection could be misleading as it does interact with it but not in the way the other planes do. You see, due to the Feywilds placement in the Planar structure, overlapping with both the Material and Shadow Plane, the connection to the Cycle of Souls is blocked. While this does mean the inhabitants of the Fey are effectively immortal, it also means that for the more powerful Fey travelling to other Planes, unassisted, is difficult or maybe even impossible. When a Fey is \u201ckilled\u201d its energy is returned to the Feywild, for most Fey the energy collects back and reforms creating a new Fey. Even though the connection to the Soul Cycle is limited it does not stop new Fey from being created, souls entering or leaving either the Material or Shadow Plane pass through the Feywild. These souls that pass through leave behind energy that coalesces and becomes what are known as Fey creatures.</p> <p>Due to this interaction with the Soul Cycle, even though the Feywild does not actually take the souls but takes the energy that the souls leave behind when they pass through, some of the more zealous Psychopomps have come to feel anger towards the Feywild. They see even taking this energy as theft and even though it\u2019s not possible some have even tried to take the energy back, only to be met with frustration and failure.</p>"},{"location":"Places/Fae/#the-titans","title":"The Titans","text":"<p>Long ago, when the Feywild covered the entirety of Omnia, The Titans - Kings and Queens of Nature - roamed the land.

Tales of those events are passed on from one generation to the next, cobbled together from gossip sessions known alternatively as \u201ccutting dust\u201d (chatting in the cutyards) and \u201cblowing cinders\u201d (telling tales around the hearth fire at one of the town\u2019s taverns).      Founded 200 years ago, Falcon\u2019s Hollow was hastily erected by a company offshoot group from The Trickster\u2019s Dice, the Lumber Consortium. Over those first desperate years, Falcon\u2019s Hollow successfully clung to its existence in the face of wild beasts, monstrous threats from deep within the surrounding Darkmoon Vale, and other horrific trials made all the more desperate by the self absorbed leadership from the Lumber Consortium itself.     The survival of Falcon\u2019s Hollow is a testament to the steely resolve of its three founding families: the taciturn Larko Clan, the brave Samkils, and the brutal Kreeds. These families weathered the Harp-Hag Massacre of 75 years ago, finally ending that conflict by marrying a Larko son off to one of the hag Ulizmila\u2019s seemingly innumerable daughters. They endured the decade long period known as the Misery, which claimed many of the children of Falcon\u2019s Hollow until the attic whisperer responsible was defeated by the eldest of the Kreed daughters, Balkri.      Eventually the three founding families began to die off. The Hobgoblin strife 20 years ago claimed the last living scion of the Samkil family, though more than a few old-timers insist that the crossbow bolt buried in the young Jebrika Samkil\u2019s back bore a suspicious resemblance to those used by Kreed\u2019s patriarch. Then, only 10 years ago, the Falcon\u2019s Feud culminated in the eradication (by mass burning) of the Larko Clan by a panicked mob who had come to believe that the Larkos had become \u201cunnatural folk\u201d - changelings and stranger kin (thanks in no small part to the rumormongering from Kreed lips). Today, Thuldrin Kreed and his son Jurin are the only surviving descendants of the original founding families, and the sole owner of the whole region\u2019s Lumber Consortium chopping rights. </p>"},{"location":"Places/Falcon%27s%20Hallow/#daily-life","title":"Daily Life","text":"<p>Far from the cares and demands of civilisation, the dense forest and crystalline river near Falcon\u2019s Hollow might seem to promise freedom, but in truth, those who dwell here do so under the oppressive auspices of the Lumber Consortium and Thuldrin Kreed\u2019s harsh vigilance. </p> <p>Despite the hardships the people have faced, the resilient folk of Falcon\u2019s Hollow find grim pride in their work. The cutyards are a pumping, bleeding heart of the town, with shifts around the clock cutting and shipping darkwood and other lumber down the River Foam. Laborers break their backs and lose limbs to saw and axe in the yards, seemingly aging several years for each one day spent toiling under these grueling conditions. They\u2019re a rough and honest (for the most part) folk who generally don\u2019t turn to heroes - their problems are their own. Though they\u2019re usually too proud to look to strangers for deliverance, recent events have forced some of the townsfolk to ask for help.     This cutyard culture dates back over a century, with rituals persisting from the earliest years of Falcon\u2019s Hollow. Disputes between loggers are settled on the river in a bout referred to as a \u201cloggerheads\u201d. Every so often, a shout rings through the yard with one logger challenging another to go loggerheads on their dispute. The combatants balance on logs in the water with a length of timber in hand. The first battered into the water is pulled out by the rest of the crew and acknowledges the truth of the other\u2019s claims. Some superstitious loggers believe the water sprites judge the contests and take delight in ensuring the wronged party gets vengeance, even in defiance of the competitors\u2019 comparative strengths and skills. From that moment on, the dispute is \u201cgiven to the river\u201d and no one speaks of it again. This phrase is also common parlance for a slight judged unworthy of actual dispute, with grumblers urged to give their complaints to the river and move on. Old Kreed approves of this logger justice, citing the old maxim, \u201cPeople are soft and bend to lies. Timber is hard; let it decide.\u201d </p> <p>Ultimately, Falcon\u2019s Hollow isn\u2019t the nicest place to live.

Sponsored 333 years ago by the Hol Maldur stone merchant guild in cooperation with the human settlers of a small hamlet called Aston, work on Petragenis was funded because of a large quarry uncovered by Ancalagon\u2019s Wake. Initially, the plan was for this new town to keep Aston as its name and for the mine to be called Petra Genis, but the quarry work overshadowed the hamlet\u2019s output and the entire area became colloquially known by the mine\u2019s combined name.      As work continued for 50 years, veins of rich iron gave way to an even more exciting discovery. The dwarfs digging unveiled a deeper chamber flush with adamantium; while outnumbered 100 to 1 by the tonnes of iron above, the price of this precious metal was close to invaluable. With stronger equipment needed from New Methismenos, word got out about the find and even those from the Five Kingdoms in the south became interested in this discovery. Scholars and legendary blacksmiths flooded in, setting up a school which turned into a university. Gentrification took hold of the mining village, and while work continued, the miners could no longer afford to live anywhere but the outskirts - to be known as the \u201cGangue\u201d. For those who benefited from these new riches, discovery of precious metal continued to increase - the chamber of adamantium led to a cave of cold iron, and then to djezet, siccatite, and even mithral. Scholars theorized how such an unusual collection of precious metals could have come about - some believed it was the treasures of Old Methismenos returned to the earth, others believed it was a dragon\u2019s horde and that digging would only lead the dwarfs to a fiery death. A more radical offshoot group of Breithmaen clerics demanded that the digging did not continue deeper, claiming that they had found a mathematical constant within each of the caves and that they could not have formed by chance - they claimed it must have been divine inspiration that created these chasms, and that digging too deep would only invoke divine wrath.  Regardless of the priests\u2019 declarations, the dwarfs continued to dig and drive wealth into the town with no ill effect. Even the most skeptical of the miners noted how unusually clean the caves were - the more superstitious of them thought that the cave itself was inviting its wealth to be plundered as a gift from Iroas. The most brazen of these groups declared that these veins of metal were indeed the lost wealth of their destroyed city, and that they were being gifted what was rightfully theirs. Whatever the truth was, Petragenis itself flourished both economically and culturally, with Rigiths University becoming an educational institute to rival anything in New Methismenos, and multiple governmental buildings being set up to control the flow of these precious goods.  After exactly 222 years of digging, the final chamber of metal was uncovered by the dwarfs. Unlike the others, this was no was no welcoming cave; the heat was intense, and toxic, flammable fumes jetted out from the rocky walls. For most, this was enough to pack up the pickaxes and leave - of course, if Iroas had permitted them such an easy and valuable dig because he wished to gift them with what was lost, then surely this inhospitable environment was a warning. Others, however, saw it as a challenge. The Breithmaen clerics gave another declaration that this chamber - more than any of them - was not to be entered, and any who did would be struck down as soon as pickaxe met stone. This fell upon deaf ears, and the miners rebutted that the town would have never grown if they always heeded warnings of the cowardly. They traveled deep into Petra Genis with protective gear and entered the final chamber, finding a vein of unidentified white stone that sparked with electricity. The few scholars that had the chance to see this stone could not agree upon its function or use for even the miners seemed terror struck at the idea of mining it. They took their meager findings to the university, and it\u2019s thought to be at this point that the miners inside gathered their courage to make their move. No one is certain what happened in the cave; when the miners did not return, a search party was sent down to investigate, and they found a smooth wall where the final chamber was.  After that point, people became very uneasy about Petra Genis mine, and many left, leaving only Rigiths University as an attraction to the south in Petregenis. During this time, the clerics of Breithmaehut decreed that they had been right in their warnings about the dwarfs\u2019 greed, and that the town should steer itself to a more \u2018proper\u2019 way of making its fortune - lest everything fall to ruin. In the ensuing years, the town was left with no choice but to capitalise on the educational aspects it was prided on, and many turned to Breithmaen worship. </p>"},{"location":"Places/Petragenis/#daily-life","title":"Daily Life","text":"<p>For those who have money in Petragenis, life is rather idillic; the environment is temperate and the 'higher' jobs that exist within the university and local government pay well enough for those lucky enough to find themselves in them not to go hungry.

While in the beginning relationships between the Ratfolk and Dwarves was strained at best, as each race had their own ideals, each realised that they had a lot to gain from working together and so both races signed a trade treaty and the \u201cNew Methaemenos Trading Outpost\u201d was constructed. In this treaty the Ratfolk would gain resources; food, minerals and other necessities, from or near the surface that were rare or impossible to cultivate in the Underdark and the Dwarves in turn would receive resources that were scarce or unobtainable near the surface as well as some of the technological inventions of the Ratfolk.</p> <p>As the years went on interest in the Underdark grew and people making their way into the Underdark would pass through the \u201cNew Methaemenos Trading Outpost\u201d using it as a sort of check point, the Ratfolk didn\u2019t mind as long as they didn\u2019t interrupt their work, for most people this would be the first time people would see the technological advancement of the Ratfolk even if was just a glimpse.

From the outside, this almost infinite city looks to be an alabaster monument to law that consists of stacked grand buildings decorated with marble reliefs. Utopia is surrounded by colossal walls which are smooth facing the city, but outwardly scarred from countless assaults. </p> <p>The denizens of the supposed \u201cperfect city\u201d consist of axiomites, inevitables, and lawful petitioners - as well as particularly powerful mortal visitors who have been permitted into the walls, though these are few and far between. The native outsiders here have an intrinsic knowledge of how to act within Utopia - on what side of the streets to walk, of where they are needed, where they work best, and even what order to sacrifice themselves in should the city require it. While the vast majority of visitors to the city find it stifling - the clean white walls and piercing gaze of statues around every perfect corner - the true denizens are utterly content with their place in the machine.</p> <p>Though all of the native outsiders intrinsically know their place, that does not mean there are no disagreements in important matters. Fundamental truths are recognised, but how to deal with violations of these laws is often an area of contention. Depending on the severity of these breaches, inevitables and axiomites will continue to pass the issue upwards in the ranks until it reaches a group of sufficient station to debate the infraction. Such debates can take decades or even centuries, usually consisting of complex equations to best determine cause and effect, and especially the ramifications on the future. While these \u2018Consortiums\u2019 are not capable of determining fate to the exact detail, their calculations are often close enough to cause some mortals to doubt their own free will. If a violation of a fundamental law is too great for any of the lesser Consortiums to deal with, it will be presented to Breithmaehut, who will enact the Council of V\u0305I\u0305 - a process in which the god clones her own \u2018consciousness\u2019 with 6000 minor deviations to debate the fundamental defiance or other emergency which requires her attention. Once the Council of V\u0305I\u0305 reaches its verdict, the decision is final and all of Utopia works to enact the precise instructions given. </p> <p>In addition to the enactment of the enforcement of fundamental laws, one of Utopia\u2019s most important functions is being the location that holds The Court of Deific Disputes. Initially planned to rest in Annanoris\u2019s realm, the Forgotten God made a request for it to fall under Breithmaehut\u2019s care in Utopia, mere decades before Pesmaenos\u2019s betrayal - while the reason for this decision is likely now only known to The Inexorable Truth, the location has remained only occasionally contested in Utopia. The Court of Deific Disputes is, as the name would suggest, used to create bindings between gods to be enforced by all parties involved, including Breithmaehut. A deal here is not lightly made, as failure to uphold such a bargain can result in a combined deific effort to send the perpetrator to The Malus Pit. </p> <p>For souls that find themselves sent to Utopia, they first arrive at one of the many sorting gates standing at the back of a long Queue, left to look upon the scarred walls of the city and the peaks of the monumental buildings within. During this time, the petitioner has the opportunity to look inwards and try to understand the fundamental truth of themselves. Such a process can take years, and can take a toll on a soul; at any time, they are free to remove themself from the queue and wander the wasteland, but such a decision is not to be taken lightly as it requires that they rejoin at the back and restart the process. Some souls never make it to the city, and instead roam as empty, desperate husks that slowly dissolve to sand - frightening reminders to any soul who lacks resolve. It\u2019s theorised that those who join The Queue can only move to the front once they\u2019ve finally come to terms with themselves, but the exact function of The Queue is a highly debated topic amongst scholars, with axiomites providing no concrete answers. </p> <p>Once the petitioner has entered Utopia\u2019s gates, they\u2019ll find themselves quickly shuffled into sorting halls where they\u2019ll be individually interviewed by one of the countless axiomites of the Petitioner Consortium, who will evaluate their skills, beliefs, morals, and achievements from their past life and assign a role from there. These roles are usually small jobs within the city to ensure its functioning, though some promising petitioners can be deemed worthy of immediate promotion to the path to become an axiomite or inevitable. They are not immediately transformed, but are admitted into the halls of the Unremittus where they go through intensive learning to reach what is deemed to be their \u2018true potential\u2019. Souls deemed to belong to a \u2018lesser role\u2019 are able to prove themselves worthy to join the Unremittus, though many simply accept their jobs, coming to realise they are still an important cog in the machine. Those who disagree with their judgement are given precisely one Omnian year to formulate a logical reason as to why their assigned role is incorrect; this will be evaluated by the Petitioner Consortium, and will be judged impartially as true or false, and enacted upon as per the judgement. For those who continue to refuse their role, they are allowed to wander Utopia without a duty - a fact that seems to be innately known to all of those in position. They are given three choices; to forever exist in the city as an outcast, to finally accept their assigned role, or to leave Utopia and the protection it provides to wander the waste, not to be readmitted without an impeccable reason. </p> <p>For a newly assigned petitioner, life within the city may seem dull, but it seems an inevitable fate for those who continue working in their positions to come to accept and eventually enjoy it. The daily life for such a petitioner is quiet and usually uneventful, but they are provided for. Despite the city\u2019s reputation as one of machines and maths, in more recent millennia entertainment venues have been constructed for souls, stated to \u2018improve quality of life\u2019 and, perhaps more importantly, \u2018boost morale and efficiency in the growing populace\u2019.</p> <p>For those who graduate into the Unremittus, their roles are much more strictly assigned into either becoming an axiomite or one of the many unit types of inevitables. The Unremittus itself is a continent sized university, which holds the Haxxon Forge in one half and the Breithmaen Iris in the other, facing true planar North and South respectively. Training for each assignment is incredibly specific, but consists of centuries worth of lessons, training, and meditation. The sheer amount of time and indoctrination often leaves the soul forgetting much of its past life, and the vast majority of prospective axiomites and inevitables have absolutely no trace left of their mortal selves by the end of their time in the Unremittus. There are, however, some very willful souls who manage to maintain some of their self, which often produces unwanted but tolerated deviations in the output of the Unremittus. Souls who graduate to become inevitables are sent into the yawning mouth of the Haxxon Forge, where they emerge hours later in their assigned and specially made machine body. Those who prove themselves worthy of becoming axiomites are to walk into a huge blue portal built into an otherwise blank marble wall in the Unremittus. It\u2019s said that this portal is one of the missing eyes of Breithmaehut\u2019s shell, but the god has not commented either way on this. When a worthy soul enters the portal, their essence is broken down into its axiomatic truths - a shimmering cloud of maths that quickly learns to reform itself into a chosen form. These new axiomites know their most efficient place in Utopia, and get about their jobs as soon as they can; many of them return to the Unremittus with the assignment to create new inevitable bodies for the Haxxon Forge. </p>"},{"location":"Places/Utopia/#language","title":"Language","text":"<p>![[Pasted image 20240209180148.png]]</p>"},{"location":"Places/Utopia/#shape-utopic-magic-ritual-1","title":"Shape Utopic Magic Ritual 1","text":"<p>Uncommon Utopic Source Big Bear Consortium 2.0 Cast\u00a01 Hour per level\u00a0Cost\u00a0Varies\u00a0Secondary Casters\u00a00+ Primary Check Divine\u00a0(expert);\u00a0or\u00a0Lore:Breithmaehut Secondary Checks Divine Range\u00a0Personal</p> <p>You Extend your mind into utopia forming magic from the raw language of order  </p> <p>Select a series of utopic runes that describe the effect you want the spell to have the GM sets the cost, and target DC based on these runes  </p> <p>Critical Success\u00a0As success but half the cost Success\u00a0You successfully learn the described spell Failure\u00a0The ritual has no effect.

Well separated by turbulent body of water, the people of each land have seldom met throughout history. </p> <p>The country itself is situated on the Great Crater - a huge fissure from which the elemental planes touch the material, and from which elementals of all types have spilled into the land. The mortals of Zhongguo are often born touched by these planes, and elemental sorcerers are not uncommon; indeed, these sorcerers have been paramount in the survival of civilisation in such a turbulent land. The country is massive - nearly the size of Omnia itself - and has many offshoot volcanic islands that are also inhabited. </p> <p>Unlike Omnia, Zhongguo never suffered from The Cataclysm, and so despite the dangers the temperamental elementals pose, civilisation itself has never faced an apocalyptic threat. However, that is not to say it has been stable - since time immemorial the country has been governed by a Thunder King. This title is bestowed on a person in possession of the F\u0113ng L\u00f3ng - five artefacts that hold the Primal God of Wind, Zephrys, in a prison. The creation of these five items was completed by The Forgotten God, and the details lost with his death; regardless, the function is clear. Whoever holds all five artefacts becomes the mortal incarnation of Zephrys, and in turn controls the weather. </p> <p>The F\u0113ng L\u00f3ng are as follows:</p> <p>The Crown of Heavens The Sword of Storms The Sash of the Gentle Stream The Robes of Fire The Boots of Earth</p> <p>This gives The Thunder King ultimate control of the land - dictating whose crops prosper and whose die, who can pass unharmed through waterways, and whose cities are torn down by storms. Such is the power of The Thunder King that all of Zhongguo bow the knee without question. However, the title does not come without its curse, and the God Zephrys is not something that can be caged without repercussions. Just as the weather changes, The Thunder King is a turbulent position that is often held for unpredictable times - sometimes numbered in days - as the power can consume those not who do not possess the will to subjugate the God. </p> <p>As such, only those who are driven - or perhaps foolish - enough to lead take hold of the F\u0113ng L\u00f3ng. Eventually a monk brotherhood was developed, the F\u0113ng Xi\u014dn, who was tasked with steering the new king into wiser decisions, and sometimes Thunder Kings would join the brotherhood itself and let a trusted other take the political power. These trustees were named the Solemn Ones, whose duties were often thankless and their reign directly tied to the current King. </p> <p>Under the power of each Thunder King's individual leadership, the nation grew quickly but erratically, developing experimental weaponry and magic that focussed on the power of the elements. With every new king, the people experienced turbulent times - some prosperous and some disastrous, but always changing. </p>"},{"location":"Places/Zhongguo%2C%20The%20Eternal%20Empire/#recent-history","title":"Recent History","text":"<p>As of 508 years ago, while Omnia was in the grasp of the Cataclysm, a new Thunder King was crowned. Unlike his predecessors, he did not take the throne after the previous King lost control of the F\u0113ng L\u00f3ng, but rather after he managed the impossible and committed regicide.</p> <p>This man is Lei Sheng, the previous Solemn One under Han Sho, and the current Thunder King. A man so hungry for power, he spent his entire duty as the Solemn One honing his will and magic to lengths that made even the Imperial Dragons nervous, with the singular goal in mind that he was to become the next and last Thunder King. </p> <p>Han Sho had been a popular King that Zhongguo has prospered under - or at least, that was the belief at the time. Lei Sheng was the one pulling the strings, directing the country and suggesting how the King exercised his power; as was to be expected of a Solemn One, this was a thankless job unrecognised by the public at large. In Lei Sheng's mind, his work was credited to an absentminded monk who would be lost without his guidance; this feeling of discontent boiled away at the Solemn One for a decade of his service, and it was in this time he started his training. He perfected his mind and body, becoming a master of magic and might alike - playing the part of a Solemn One by day, and consuming the power of Oni, dragon, and elemental alike in the secrecy of dark. </p> <p>By the end of the decade, Lei Sheng was almost the most powerful mortal in the material plane. While perhaps naught compared to the manifestation of Zephrys, he was more than cunning enough to devise a plan to slay him. As part of the F\u0113ng Xion, Han Sho had neglected to look upon his people or his Solemn One; Lei Sheng took his ignorance as an opportunity, and organised a meeting to discuss some fictional oncoming danger. As The Thunder King's back was turned to look through the eyes of the wind at this 'oncoming disaster', Lei Sheng drew the Sword of Storms from its scabbard and thrust it through the back of Han Sho. As soon as the divine blade pierced his chest, the Thunder King fell dead - but the Sash of Gentle Streams unfurled from the body as the last beat of the King's heart thundered through his corpse and slipped from the grasp of Lei Sheng into the open air, unrelenting despite the usurper's magic.</p> <p>As he gathered the remaining F\u0113ng L\u00f3ng, Sheng wondered if the lost Sash would diminish his powers - and if it was a sign of disapproval from Zephrys. Regardless, he did not let such doubts sway him, and as he donned the final item - The Crown of Heavens - he felt the power of godhood surge through him like lightning. </p> <p>Thunder King Lei Sheng, The Usurper of the Skies and the Eternal Emperor, reins Zhongguo to this day. Insurmountably powerful even without the Sash, though unable to calm the waters of the Sunken Sea, The Eternal Emperor rules with an iron fist and has expanded Zhongguo across countless other smaller nations. Disobedience is met with death, and the people now know an era of bloody stability that has lasted far longer than any other in history. Despite his unquestioned power, Lei Sheng has hunted for the Sash so that he can claim his ultimate goal - full dominance of the Primal God Zephrys.</p>"},{"location":"blog/","title":"Blog","text":""}]}
