## History
Edgewater is one of if not the most powerful wizards alive on the material plane, coming from a mixed lineage
- they came to LaerHyme when they were 17 (about 80 years ago) still very much a youth for a half elf. Not much is known of their family background their human father was tight lipped wishing only the best for their son.
- Edgewater studied hard gaining the title of ArD in the university specialising in foreign magical practices something that was frowned upon heavily at the time. They travelled the Deep sections of the university uncovering hidden passages that lead to tunnels into the Deep.
- After his father passed when Edgewater was in his mid 30s he abandonded his tenure is search of truth, decending down into the ruins under LaerHyme that he had rediscovered lost passages as well as records talking about the founding of LaerHyme
- In their travels they came across the Derro
- coming back to LaerHyme 11 years later with new found knowledge and power this has served them in rising to the top
