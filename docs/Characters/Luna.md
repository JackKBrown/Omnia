She eventually made friends with some of her peers but it did cause the young girl to develop a speculative nature which has shaped her perception of people and her mother

when approaching her 18th birthday the tribe was attacked by a pack of werewolves that infected luna and killed the majority of the tribe, luna was overcome with the moonfever and followed the pack for several months before coming across [[celeste]] another godspawn with a gift for noticing the potential for greatness within others. They helped luna escape her crazed state and become firm friends travelling together on odd quests for a couple years. during this time Luna refused to contact Illuminir filled with anger of her absence in her youth and how she didn't stop the werewolf attack that killed off her tribe.
