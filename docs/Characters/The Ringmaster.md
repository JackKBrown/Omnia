A powerful cleric of [[Iumatre]] who travelled Omnia transforming innocents into monsters to perform in his circus. 

He aimed to aid a powerful Chuul Ritual underneath [[Crozetta]] after orchestrating the theft of a powerful artefact that belonged to [[Lady Damocles]]. This ritual was stopped by [[Zethe]], [[Celeste]], and [[Luna]] in an underground city.

Eventually, he made his way to Linthumveil where he tried to transform Luna, daughter of Illuminir, into a beastly werewolf. He was again stopped by the combined efforts of Zethe, Celeste, and [[Eliopeth]] - this time losing his life in the fight.
