Lazarus is a cold and seemingly emotionless man that looks to be in his early 30s, around 5’8” with a slender build. He has short-medium messy grey hair, light brown skin and grey eyes. On his waist he has a Tome that is connected to The Lexicon Archives. 
He was once a powerful Arch-Mage from the distant past that committed a crime against [[Katálixi]] and The Lexicon Archives, stripped of his memories he has been sent on this mission. He is a Lore Oracle with Loremaster and Linguist Dedication.

Lazarus is a character in Utopia Quest II.
