## intro

A city built on a swamp, jens is a multicultural place often glossed over by other city states/ countries. Founded well before the ending of the cataclysm jens is a refuge for undesirables, as well as a melting pot for many ancestries.  
Originally the town was an ancestral home for lizardfolk, but with the cataclysm many who were afflicted with minor mutations found themselves unwanted by the big cities as well as some species such as goblins, orcs, and other more chaotic peoples found themselves unwelcome. These people retreated into the wilderness were they encountered the lizardfolk many fights broke out over differences in culture but as people began to realize that the taint could not penetrate this swampy land as easily they tried to settle. Jens (short for jenseit) is the resulting cluster of settlements. The city is built on several layers clutching desperately onto trees and large rocks (the sielsteen) with different groups more commonly living in different layers the toppers (fleshwarps, orcs, goblins) living in treehouse like structures, the baruns (short for barge runners lizardfolk, humans) living atop floating buildings and running the cities barges which allow for transport without knowing what areas are safe to wade in, and the skulkers (lizardfolk, azarketi, swampweed leshy)  those that live in or below the waters surface. This gathering of people lived in relative peace with minor skirmishes and squabbles breaking out over time until the end of the cataclysm when the taint dispersed so did the people of jens leaving the unskilled and the undesirables behind to fend for themselves the city may have dissolved entirely if not for the efforts of Reglis Almock a Lizardfolk merchant with connections to outside lizardfolk caravans. They found that the sielsteen could soak up the taint explaining the resilience of the swamp and sold the sielsteen to cities wanting to remove the taints influence faster so they could expand faster. This economic boom allowed the city to stabilize and find new ventures.
