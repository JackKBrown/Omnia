The Watch are an organisation that consists of some of the mightiest heroes in Omnia, who are stationed atop the Greywall - a huge cliff face that was created by the upheaval of Azathoth Ebonwing during the Cataclysm. The Greywall stands between New Methymaenos - and the rest of civilised Omnia - and the Wastes, a sprawling tundra that encompasses the far north of the continent.
	While any person of sufficient strength can join the watch, the main factions are vigilant dwarfs from their great city, the disgraced Ironless who wish to atone for their sins in the eyes of their brethren, and the constructed WISP (Wasteland Investigation (&) Survival Poppets) - an elite and small faction of automatons created by the ratfolk to help with The Watch’s duties. Other people who join the ranks of The Watch do so for a variety of reasons, be they a sense of heroics, a want of greater challenge, a punishment, a desire to understand, or a want of greater magic - while each serves the same overall purpose, members of this elite organisation are incredibly varied. 
	Their leader is the High Praetor, also known as the ‘Grand Inheritor of Iroas's Bloodline’ - an individual deemed worthy enough to inherit some of Iroas’s divine powers, acting as his envoy upon the martial plane. These chosen few exist only one at a time, only being replaced upon the death of the current High Praetor, and they are usually raised from birth for this very purpose. Those who don’t originate from New Methymaenos often find the practice outdated, believing that the High Praetor should be chosen from the ranks of The Watch by merit, and not the whims of a god.
