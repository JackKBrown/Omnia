Long ago, the Forsaken Fleet was a mighty armada of gallant knights and virtuous paladins, led by the noble Captain Lysander Darkmoor. They sailed the treacherous seas in the name of justice, hunting down pirates, sea monsters, and all manner of evil that threatened the coastal cities. Their flagship, the Sable Serpent, was a symbol of hope and valor, known to all who dwelled by the sea.

The Curse

During one of their voyages, the Forsaken Fleet came upon a mysterious island shrouded in perpetual fog. The island was rumored to be the resting place of an ancient and powerful artifact known as the Heart of Dread, a gem said to grant immortality at a terrible cost. Unbeknownst to Captain Darkmoor, the artifact was cursed by a vengeful sea witch who sought to trap the souls of all who dared to claim it.Driven by greed and the promise of eternal life, the crew disobeyed their captainâ€™s warnings and seized the Heart of Dread. The moment they touched the gem, a powerful curse was unleashed, transforming the once-noble crew into monstrous, flesh-eating ghouls. Their bodies decayed, and their minds twisted with insatiable hunger, yet they were bound to the island, unable to leave its shores.

The Eternal Feast

The curse did not stop at mere transformation. The Forsaken Fleet's hunger could only be sated by the flesh of the living. Over the centuries, the island became known as the Isle of Shadows, and stories of the flesh-eating ghouls kept sailors far away. However, every so often, a shipwreck or an unwary traveler would land on the island, only to become the next meal for the cursed crew.Captain Darkmoor, now a ghoul lord, retained a semblance of his former self and sought a way to break the curse. He delved into forbidden lore, hoping to find a way to free his men and himself from their eternal damnation. Despite his efforts, the curse's grip only tightened, and the Heart of Dread remained unyielding in its dark power.

Rise of the Flesh-Eating Courts

In recent times, whispers of a powerful necromancer reaching the Isle of Shadows began to spread. This necromancer, drawn by the dark power of the Heart of Dread, struck a bargain with Captain Darkmoor. In exchange for aiding the necromancer's conquests, the captain and his crew would be given dominion over the seas once more, their hunger used as a weapon against their enemies.Thus, the Forsaken Fleet became the Flesh-Eating Courts, an undead army that rises from the depths to terrorize the living. They are led by Captain Darkmoor, whose undying determination to lift the curse drives them forward. Their ships, spectral and rotting, sail under the cover of night, and their ghastly forms strike fear into the hearts of all who dare to cross their path.

The Endless Quest

Captain Darkmoor and his Flesh-Eating Courts now scour the seas and the coastal lands, seeking powerful artifacts and ancient magic that might finally break their curse. Their hunger is a constant reminder of their plight, driving them to conquer and consume. As they carve a path of terror through the world, they leave behind tales of horror and the lingering question: can they ever truly be freed from their undead fate?
