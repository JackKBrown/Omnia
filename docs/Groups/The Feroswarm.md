The Feroswarm are the ungodly amalgamation of flesh and machine, created during the birth of Uber-Seccentium and causing the civil war and technological decline of The Warren. While the Ratfolk managed to keep the majority of it contained, a force of the Feroswarm managed to escape and grow.

They are a soulless but intelligent hivemind, their intelligence only overshadowed by their instinctual desire to consume and integrate all other beings and technology. Even just one surviving member of the swarm is enough for it to reproduce and repopulate. They consume everything in their way, leaving the areas they pass through desolate and ruined.

The Prime Directive is the manifestation of the swarm's will and instincts, an entity within the swarm that has some level of influence. It is a transient entity that has the ability to move between different members of the swarm.
