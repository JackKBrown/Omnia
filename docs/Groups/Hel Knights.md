## About
Despite their typical moniker of Hellknight, the order of Dextra Ordinis or Hellknights is dedicated to furthering order throughout Omnia be it LE, LN, or LG the point is to halt the spread of chaos. Founded by Udugiuwahi, a servant of Breithmaehut after the cleansing, Hellknights use powers granted by lawful outsiders to further the goals of local governments as well as their own personal agenda.
