## Language
The language of the lizardfolk heavily uses declension based on the form of nouns since they have a Heirarchy almost like a gender this also influences verbs used but verb usage is more a instinctual thing e.g a first "On' " of something uses more commanding verbs where as a third "Pah' " of something uses more humble verbs you can do things either way but it just sounds wrong to native speakers
