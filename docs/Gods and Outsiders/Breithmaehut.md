Brief Description
The shell of Breithmaehut was built long ago by ancient axiomites - beings of pure mathematical law created from the fundamental rules of creation. As they were creatures who came into being as concepts of an ‘order’ that did not yet truly exist, they fought against their contradictory nature by creating said order. Initially starting small, they enforced the law of gravity, coalescing motes of dust that floated in the void until it was an expansive planet. Not content with an expanse of empty dirt, they transformed the latent chaotic matter around them into shelters which rapidly transformed from shacks to grand structures as the increase in order fed the equations which enforced it. With a city created, they deemed it necessary to inhabit it, and thus enforced the laws of society, filling it with new axiomites. Finally, once this perfect city had been created, the Fundamental Axiomites - those of physics, outsider society, magic, and planes - enforced their final law, that being that their laws should be upheld. Working together, they created a gargantuan golem out of the remaining latent entropy that had once surrounded their new eternal city; a towering orb of marble and metal that could protect and enforce the Fundamental Laws, and they called it Breithmaehut. 

Breithmaehut was the first Inevitable, and the inspiration of the creation of those outsiders. Initially they were created for protection of the fundamentals as a lesser Primal God - a divine golem without thought, emotion, or any desire other than its assigned duty. For millions of years it stayed that way - stoically weathering the assaults against reality from Diatarachtos and its Proteans. This Primal form, Breithmaehut M. I, took the form of a huge orb with a single lense for the Fundamental Axiomatics to peer out from. As the Protean threat developed, and the agents of Chaos swelled in size and variety, the forms of Breithmaehut too evolved. Developments like the M. III centaur-like construction, or the more humanoid cloaked M. IV golem helped secure a stable reality for the development of the universe at large. 

Upon the birth of the Forgotten God - the God of Mortal Ascension, and the first pure Mortal God - the fate of the Inexorable Truth would change permanently. The Lost God, the father of Pesmaenos and Iroas, believed that society had to develop for mortals to prosper, and no longer could they be left to dwell in caves or burrows to be picked off by monsters. In order to achieve his lofty goals, he first created a powerful spell - a legendary version of an enchantment used even today - Awaken. With this newly forged power, He cast it upon the mindless Breithmaehut M. V and granted it a consciousness. Initially confused at its state, it began to learn with The Lost God, and of his plans to uplift society and the help he needed. Breithmaehut M. V made their first decision, and rebuilt herself into Breithmaehut M. VI - the current form of the God of Law. 

They proved an invaluable ally to the Lost God, safeguarding societal development from outside influence and using the souls of lawful mortals to create new Axiomites and Inevitables to continue to protect the evolution of mortalkind from Chaotic influence. Initially struggling with their new mind, as society developed and under the guidance of the Forgotten God, they developed a will and personality of their own - fully transitioning from a Primal God to a Mortal God. 

It has been theorised by scholars that, had Pesmaenos not committed the Great Blasphemy, Breithmaehut and the Forgotten God would have steered societies all over Omnia into a state of moral perfection. Others argue that the land would be left a uniform and conformist greyscape, devoid of passion or individuality. Whatever the case may have been, it's not for us to know, as the Forgotten God was slain by his own son, and it was Breithmaehut and Iroas who brought the Betrayer to justice.

"At first, consciousness was a curse. Free will a blight upon my once perfect mind. But J̶͖͆̅̔s̵͙̗̓0̴̛͍̌̾1̸̰̦̄n̴̘̰͂ͅf̵̭̙̤̈́̆0̴͎̅2̴͍̪͇͘p̶͉̫̝̀a̸̟͖̍l̷͖͕͠ brought me understanding. Care. Compassion. Mortals - paradoxical creatures who exist because of free will - were to be my charge. I was initially cautious, not simply of them but of this new capacity to feel… and then I was curious. Under His guidance, I felt first fear, and then curiosity, and then care. For those paradoxical creatures and their advancements. I do not often dwell on what could have been, but even now the Council of V̅I̅ debates on His influence; even their perfect logic cannot come to a conclusion. I can only state the Inexorable Truth that I became something else after the Awakening, and that I felt hope, dread, happiness, sadness, curiosity, and even an approximation of love.
  "Proceeding this hope was the Great Blasphemy. The Betrayer killed J̶͖͆̅̔s̵͙̗̓0̴̛͍̌̾1̸̰̦̄n̴̘̰͂ͅf̵̭̙̤̈́̆0̴͎̅2̴͍̪͇͘p̶͉̫̝̀a̸̟͖̍l̷͖͕͠.
    "I then felt a new emotion. Hatred."
