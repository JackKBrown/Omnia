## Brief Description
Illuminir is one of the “weaker” gods, if such a thing exists, rather than being the single worshiped god, they're part of a group of outsiders called the Agathions. Hence the title Speaker of the Agathions. Agathions are outsiders born as mortals that have ascended to nirvana via enlightenment. Illuminir is the most well known of the group standing for the one thing all agree upon, the caring of young. 
Depictions of Illuminir that exist show them typically as a bear sometimes adorned with jewelry made of blooming flora representing the harmonious relationship with nature and Ananoris. Alternatively they depict Illuminir as a wolf with similar furnishings though this is less popular and considered heretical by some as a reference to the myth of were-wolves/creatures being those that have fallen from the path of enlightenment or the misguided young of Illuminir. Regardless, Illuminir is always shown to be surrounded by various young creatures.
