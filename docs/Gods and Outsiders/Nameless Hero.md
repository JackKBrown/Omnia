## Alignment
LN, but will work well with LG in most circumstances - though do not show pity when it interferes with their duty. They work very well with the N psychopomps when it comes to guarding souls. 

## Titles 
  - The Final Rest 
  - Guardian of Champions 
  - Sentinel of Souls 

## Iconography 
The Nameless Hero’s sigil is often carved in stone on the graves of heroes, especially those with finished duty. This is not exclusive to hero’s graves, and some will carve it in the graves of family members in hopes it will ward against necromancers.. 

## Associated outsiders
The Nameless Hero works well with psychopomps, and the occasional Marut. The outsider himself does not seem to fit into an exact category, though most scholars decide to call him an aberrant psychopomp and leave it at that. 

##Tenets 
  - Do not raise souls who wish to rest 
  - Do not raise undead, and destroy all undeath that cross your path
  - Respect the cycle of souls, and venerate just death 

## Sect of The Unyielding
The sect of The Nameless Hero who aim to defend the graves of fallen heroes.
