When Pesmaenos committed The Great Blasphemy, the emotional ripple through time from both Gods and Mortals created a Siktempora of deific power. While not a full god in their own right, Hallowhusk feeds well off evil acts committed in the name of righteousness, especially in the name of good gods. 

More than that, at particular times of weakness Hallowhusk poses as other gods to their followers in times of crisis and gently whispers blasphemous acts to answer their prayers. It takes great delight in righteous champions falling to evil, especially through great acts of betrayal.

Iconography 

As Hallowhusk thrives off misery from acts misattributed to the divine, its holy symbols are nearly all abominable alterations to other holy symbols. Often used to mock Worshippers of other gods, a symbol of Hallowhusk is often left at sites where another God's followers are thought to have blasphemed. For example, a battleground that held host to a bloody crusade from the misguided followers of Illuminir may have a detached and bloody bear paw nailed to a tree nearby. 

Associated outsiders 

While it claims no ownership of them, and they in turn rarely acknowledge it, Hallowhusk is understood to be an extraordinarily powerful Siktempora. 

Associated People

Very few are foolish enough to associate with Hallowhusk. Usually it will appear to those who are losing their faith, or are too blinded by it to see right from wrong, masquerading as their god and stringing them along until there is nothing but a faithless husk. 

Sometimes those spiteful few who grow so disenfranchised with their religion that they hate those who continue to follow it will willingly give their lives to the Blasphemy in hopes of spiting their once comrades. 

Tenets

Hallowhusk has one goal - to twist good intentions to evil actions, and its tenants reflect this malign intent. For the few who worship Hallowhusk, they must follow only a few simple edicts:

Worship no other god
Do not respect hallowed ground or customs 
Twist religious Scripture and sow doubt in the hearts of the faithful
Desecrate holy sites with abominable alterations to their hallowed symbols

Sect of Blasphemy
The sect of Hallowhusk who aim to destroy the sacred and instil hatred of the gods.
