## Brief Description

Diatarachtos is said to be the first of all according to followers or the “Fracture” whether this is true isn’t really known it prefers not to speak directly to the majority of its followers instead letting them discover for themselves. Apostles of the Fracture recruit few followers instead letting those that seek the knowledge of the universe to find them. The ultimate goal of any apostle is to witness as much as they can, they try not to interfere where possible. Believing that witnessing new events brings them closer to Diatarachtos, the one that witnesses all. 

The few depictions of Diatarachtos that exist show them as a many headed serpent an amalgamation of proteans. Apostles believe that all Proteans are the detached heads of Diatarachtos, some of its many eyes given manifest.

Diatarachtos is sometimes know as the "butterfly god", though he's not often depicted as the insect by his followers. Instead, this title refers to the myth - or theory - that for every choice made by the free will of a mortal creates a divergence in time; a new path created, which in turn can create its own new paths. Some scholars theorise that for every one of these paths created, a new head grows.
