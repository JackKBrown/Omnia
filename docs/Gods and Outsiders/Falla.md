Brief Description:
Created by means not common to any God, Falla was created in a misty form out of greed, rage and trickery by the previous queen of Ocean Point.  Carrying on those feelings, she decided to take her own shape, stealing the body of any mortal scholar she found. Spreading the word of her own awakening, she found herself bound to Ocean Point, unable but by no means powerless. Spreading her own seed of treachery in the town, she formed the name of “The Deal Maker”. Able to find anyone in duress like a wolf hunts its prey, she takes the form of anyone needed, making a deal with deadly consequences for the other party. Knowing this was getting out of hand, the Queen had her bound to a vessel deep within the castle but many years passed, many rulers took the Queen's place and a great war resulted in Falla being once again released to Ocean Point. The current King now stuck, Falla’s followers have assembled to release her from her bindings to Ocean Point and allow her to be free to the world.
Fallas Followers:
Fallas followers consist of great scholars kicked out of colleges for their way of thinking and mages who dare to venture their magic further. Anyone naive enough they will try to recruit. The gift to them is great knowledge not given easily, knowledge no mortal possesses. In return, they work to allow her to break beyond the barrier of Ocean Point and the ability to venture wherever she pleases. No easy feat and one Falla will do anything to achieve.
