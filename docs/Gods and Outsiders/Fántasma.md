## Brief Description:
Fántasma has said to have been around since the first creature felt fear, he dwells in the darkness and feeds on the fear felt and created by all creatures. It’s said that all innate fears were created by Fántasma and for as long as a child is scared of the dark or a man is afraid of dying Fántasma will be there feeding off of it. The natural created fear is not enough for Fántasma for he is always hungry, always craving more and so he will infiltrate the dreams of people influencing them and corrupting them, these people then spread and create more fear believing that if they satisfy Fántasma he will free them from the never ending nightmare Fántasma inflicts on them, little do they know that Fántasma is one with endless hunger.

As his influence grew, Fántasma felt that he alone could not harvest fear efficiently enough and so corrupted Psychopomps converting them into Sakhils, entities that take the form of mortal fears which he uses to spread and harvest fear from mortals.

Fántasma can take the forms of any creature's fear, often using that to scare and intimidate them so that he can bend them to his will. Though a form he likes to take is that of a jet black owl; with long shadowy wings, the underneath of the wings being thousands of eyes.
