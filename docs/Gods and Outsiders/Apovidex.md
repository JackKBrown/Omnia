CG - An avenging angel coated in an armour of steel, his back covered by spines topped by the heads of the daemon, demon, and devil Lords. Said to have once been a Daemon Lord himself in the distant past, he was thrust into the Forge of the Archons, and came out rebirthed as a creature of molten metal with razor tipped iron wings. Being rebirthed by the power of good itself changed the Daemon lord and turned his anger on his past kin. Initially chained by [[Lawful Good Plane]], Apovidex eventually broke free as a tide of demons assaulted the plane, and pulled two molten blades from the forge, taking to the skies. He carved a path of bloody carnage through the Invaders, halting their advance in a tide of blood and fire. As the last demon died, he laid chase into the void, disappearing for a millenia before appearing in Elysium with the promise to act in times of great need, coming down from the sky in a blaze of glory to save the innocent from great evil with no hesitation. It is said that his great blades cannot harm the innocent, and that when Apovidex descends to the battlefield he cleaves huge swathes of the enemy down, leaving the innocent standing.
