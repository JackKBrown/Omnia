## Iconography 
A huge circular maw of iron that encompasses an orb of obsidian. 

## Associated Outsiders 
Skrolos spawned the daemonkin from its endless hatred - creatures of pure evil and malice who want to see all of reality torn asunder, and those who live in it to be cast into eternal torture.

## Associated People
Very few would ever wish to worship Skrolos, for it hates everything - whether you are its greatest champion or its mightiest enemy, it knows only hatred. The only way to make some sort of deal with it is by making the dangerous decision to channel that hatred, so that it can be spread unto others through awful rituals and catastrophic acts. 

Instead, Skrolos gains most of its powers from the hatred that dwells in the hearts of all mortals. Even the valiant champion may falter with a brief moment of anger - even righteous wrath - which feeds The Primal Annihilator. His ardent cultists are fully nihilistic, wishing to tear down the world and believing that eventually their god will swallow it all.

Brief Description 
Skrolos is a formless black pool that writhes within the abyss, dragging anything that draws close into its inky form and dissolving it to nothingness, destroying the soul in the process. Some have likened it to a black mirror of the river of souls, whereas others think it is akin to a huge malevolent ooze. Whatever it is, Skrolos was named by the other gods - a name that reached the knowledge of mortals through strange nightmares. 

While The Dweller Below feeds off the hatred of mortals, most believe that it is a primal god - the god of The End. The inevitable nothing that awaits everything in the end.
