## Post - Death (Cessàtyr)
Having in roads with the lord of [[Tyranous]] some would think would have its perks, but for udu this wasn't true or at least not directly. As much as Pesmaenos would have found it amusing to let udu struggle to the top for centuries, udu entered the realm of the dead willingly her soul bound for Tyranous. Having already familiarised herself with the magics of [[Tartarus]] It took udu three days to gather enough energy to barter with pesmaenos for her current position, the lord of crows claimed they were disapointed and expected them to do it in two.
