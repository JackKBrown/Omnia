## What is a God?
A god is just any conscious/ semi conscious intent that has a large amount of power behind it. The thing that unites gods is the sheer quantity of power they have so much that they can use that power to shape the plane of their power's origin to their desire.

"What are the gods you ask, well it's not a hard set thing, it's like asking what's the difference between an acorn and a 10,000 year old oak and I suppose in that analogy we find our first answer. An arbiter or imp is to a god as an acorn is to our great oak. Every creature with some investiture of extra material energy could potentially be the god with enough time and gathering of power. An outsider being a creature with a strong connection to a plane. A god is just an outsider with enough power behind it that you'd be foolish not to call it whatever fancy name it wants you to call it. "

## The Cycle of Souls
Upon death, soul gets judged by flowing through the River Delthune - the river that runs from Ananoris - and finds its way into one of its tributaries after judgement to the most fitting plane. 

There the person's soul becomes a petitioner, and integrates in a way that is fitting for the plane. The majority of petitioners never become outsiders, but instead fade away into the planes (and back into the cycle of souls) after centuries (or longer). During this time, they begin a second life, initially retaining their memories but slowly shifting to become more exemplary of their new home plane - the older the petitioner, the less mortal they are. Usually the stronger willed petitioners (not always the most powerful in life) will become an outsider, and once that outsider is slain, they too will return to the cycle 

Of course, one may ask, why would a mortal ever worship an evil god, knowing that they are likely to end up in an awful place like [[Tyranous]]? Firstly, many are totally unaware of the alignment of their souls, and so don't realise that is their fate until it's too late. Secondly, those who have the power to realise their fate know they can gain a leg-up on the competition should they invest enough power into their soul in their mortal lifetime. Many a balor or pit fiend started as an overly ambitious, wholly evil cleric who started the rat race of their afterlife ahead.
