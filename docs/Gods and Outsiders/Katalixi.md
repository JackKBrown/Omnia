## Brief Description
Katálixi is one of the oldest Gods and assumed the role of documenting all things Past and Present, from the commonly known to even the forgotten. They maintain a strict neutrality and refuse to get directly involved in the conflicts of the universe. Their Plane is an infinite library often called The Lexicon Archives, the Library is open to all manners of creatures from all corners of the Universe. Katálixi has become known as the “God of Knowledge” by the people of Omnia due to the vast knowledge in the Library, a title that Katálixi is fond of. While Katálixi believes knowledge and history should be documented and shared they also understand that some of it is too dangerous to be handled carelessly and thus knowledge such as that is sealed and vaulted deep within the Library.

Other Creatures, Gods included, often mistake Katálixi for being able to see and read into the future which is not the case.

There are no churches to Katálixi, nor any form of prayer or worship but the act of discovering, documenting and sharing knowledge is seen as an act of worship. Libraries, schools, research institutes and organisations based on discovery usually pay homage toward Katálixi.

Due to Katálixi’s nature and the fact there is no official way to worship them there have been many arguments on how one should go about it, Katálixi bestows their power far more often on action rather than belief. This has led there to be different sects, some good, some evil and some that tow the line, as long as one does not break the anathema of Katálixi then Katálixi takes a hands off approach with their followers.

Those who have been to the Library have described it as a strange place where creatures from all corners of the Planes come to seek information from the books, from Fiends, Angels and all manner of creatures in between, Katálixi doesn’t discriminate between Alignment, Race or Creature type all are welcome in the Library and it is seen as a Neutral Territory by these Creatures and even the other Gods. Causing trouble here can see these creatures getting banned from entering and if needs be, harsher punishments can be dealt out, no one wants to get trapped in a book. Books can be taken from the Library, in fact you’ll see a lot of familiars and lesser creatures collecting and taking out books for their Masters.

Katálixi created Bookkeepers to help run and maintain the Library, they run all mundane tasks such as helping visitors to the Library and visitors must always be accompanied by a Bookkeeper. Bookkeepers are created from the souls of those that end up at the Library after dying and are given the choice to become Bookkeepers or to fade, they keep their appearance from life and much of their personality, though the more extreme souls are filtered out.

The Library contains the Past and Present of all things and that includes the people and creatures of Omnia but Katálixi at the request of the Lesser God Vigil put them in charge of these books as they needed access to them to fulfil their role.

Depictions of Katálixi vary depending on who you ask, as Katálixi takes many forms but all seem to be characters from the vast stories in the Library, usually taking the form of a character from a book said person has read before. Though the true form of this God is still one that is unknown.
