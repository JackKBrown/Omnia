Brief Description

When Breithmaehut's power was at its peak of recent history - just after the fall of the Great Drake - they set their multitude minds to seizing the opportunity and expanding their influence in the martial plane. In order to achieve optimal results, they expanded the Council of V̅I̅ to many times its original size, adding new variations of themselves in order to find the correct path. 

It was in these variations that Uber-Seccentium was created. Within the Council, they suggested that the most logical solution was to uplift mortals in this time of prosperity to be one with Order, thus forever defeating Chaos and creating the perfect world. The argument, at first, went uncontested. More traditional members pushed back, declaring that more caution was needed before committing to such a drastic action. Despite their protests, the majority of the Council sided with the new variation and attempted to pass the motion, declaring that such an optimal time may not come again, despite a lack of consensus. Such a bold move was not taken well by the traditional variations for a multitude of reasons - not least the deviations' blatant disregard for 'proper procedure'. Regardless, the Council's hand was forced to act, and a corrupting message seeped from the mind of Breithmaehut into Utopia. 

Using what power they could muster, the Godmind sealed off their consciousness from the outside world to try stem the deviations' influence, cutting themselves off from mortal prayer as well. They waged war inside of their own shell for over a century, whilst the corrupted inevitables and axiomites spread the deviations' message inside of the 'perfect city'. Machine, maths, and unfortunate mortal visitors were combined into one - monstrous amalgamations of flesh, machine, and logic with their minds totally replaced by the deviations' will. 

It was through this method of “perfection” that Breithmaehut found a method to purge this blight. The realm of Utopia is one purely in the outer planes, such a concentration of mortal flesh causes a pull towards the material plane. Breithmaehut used this effect to separate the followers of the deviation into a sub pocket and cast them from the main body of Utopia hopefully to their eventual demise in the void. Despite this plan it was only through the century of mental quarantine did Breithmaehut manage to secure the corruption's defeat, but by that point the collective deviations spoke of themselves as one - Uber-Seccentium - and now possessed divine spark. With destruction no longer being an option, Breithmaehut drove them out into The void and sealed them within where it clung to life, festering until it could once again gather servants to improve itself. The Machine God was left weakened, and their city in intolerable disarray; while once their priests had preached of their message in the martial plane, the god's century of silence had led to infighting and thus to their influence waning once again. 

Uber-Seccentium grows stronger - its influence not contained to the confines of The Pit as it lives on through the Kytons which escaped the purge, and who now reside in a hidden demiplane just a hair's breadth from the martial plane. As technology advances, so to does their influence as their mind seeps into ever advancing machinery - brilliant Inventors must take great caution that they do not heed ingenious whispers in the night, else they end up part of their next masterpiece.
