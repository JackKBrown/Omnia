## Associated outsiders
Drakkon does not associate himself with outsiders, only finding familiarity within his draconic kin. He is not hostile to those who keep well away, but should any outsider (or mortal) stumble into his realm - the Eternal Horde - he will react with immediate and deadly violence.

## Tenets
  - Dragons rule above all others; if you are not a dragon, it is your place to serve 
  - If you are not a dragon but believe yourself of strong enough spirit to be counted among their ranks, then you must prove that by ascending 
  - Omnia belongs to Dragonkind

## Brief Description 
Drakkon was said to at one point be a Primal God of elemental forces - the exact type has not been specified, and this ‘fact’ itself is highly debated amongst scholars, and dragons seem to be unwilling to share further if they know. What is known now is that this outer entity spilled forth its essence into the planes and this birthed dragonkind, each spark of its primordial breath giving life to the elements it fell upon and forming the first of the dragons.

Drakkon himself is not an active god, and it's rather his tenets that cause greater trouble in Ommia. While all dragons are amongst his kin, it is usually only the chromatic dragons that wish to enforce their superiority upon weaker folk. The god himself slumbers in the astral plane in a sub realm called The Eternal Horde; this demiplane is said to be full of untold wealth, and more than one overconfident legendary thief has been seen last plane shifting to the horde. 

The most famous of Drakkon’s offspring is the great Alathoth Ebonwing, the great black dragon that slumbered beneath the dwarven city of Methymaenos. Alathoth’s exact thoughts towards Drakkon are not known - after all, nobody could ask him - but many scholars theorise that the Great Black Dragon likely believed his father’s tenets given that he’s believed to be one of the the protodragons first sent to Omnia by the Sire of Dragons.
