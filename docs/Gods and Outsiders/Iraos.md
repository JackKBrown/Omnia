## Brief description 
The successor to the fallen God, and the brother of the Fallen Angel, Iroas stands as a bastion against the evil of Omnia. Having seen first hand what ambition and evil could bring to the world Iroas swore to counter the influence of evil outsiders. After his father fell, Iroas looked upon Omnia and saw that this evil had spread amongst many of the mortals, in his rage he almost sent the armies of heaven to wipe the slate anew. However, in a moment of clarity he saw that amongst the evil of the world there were beacons of good who had fought in his fathers name. It is said that in this moment of clarity Iroas realised that his fathers creation were worthy of his protection, he spoke to the first of his ‘champions’ and swore to rid Omnia of disorder and evil. 

Iroas is known to many of the races of Omnia; Humans typically see him as a radiant lion who speaks to a chosen few with guidance. Elves see him as a Golden Dragon who swoops into battle in their time of need. Dwarfs often see him as a large rock golem with the visage of one of their kind. It is said that he also speaks to certain craftsmen and women whilst they create all manners of wonderful creations in the service of defeating evil.
