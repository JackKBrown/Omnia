Brief description
According to myth Iumatar was once an elven queen, leader of a great grove but one that had turned their back on the preservation of nature. A group of traveling beastkin came to her grove seeking shelter, Iumatar welcomed them warmly giving them wine and meat as the kin slept she spirited away their children, using them for experiments. Awakening the kin were distraught followers of illuminir they treasured their young, begging for their return they were chased from the city. Seeking aid from their god illuminir with the help of ananoris gave them strength to storm the city. Seeing their children or what they'd turned into they wept as oozes tasted the air and crept along the queen's dungeons. In a rage the kin sealed Iumatar in her dungeons thinking to cause her some of the pain she inflicted but the vile nature of the queen have her strength the oozes could not suggest something so evil and the mother of monsters was born. To this day Iumatar takes great pleasure in corrupting beastkin into lycanthropes as well as corrupting the animals of ananoris.
