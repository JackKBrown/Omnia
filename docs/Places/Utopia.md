## About

- Home of the Inevitables and Axiomatics
- Location of The Court of Deific Disputes

What was once an island of dirt formed from the coalescing fundamental laws is now a sprawling marble metropolis that never sleeps. From the outside, this almost infinite city looks to be an alabaster monument to law that consists of stacked grand buildings decorated with marble reliefs. Utopia is surrounded by colossal walls which are smooth facing the city, but outwardly scarred from countless assaults. 

The denizens of the supposed “perfect city” consist of axiomites, inevitables, and lawful petitioners - as well as particularly powerful mortal visitors who have been permitted into the walls, though these are few and far between. The native outsiders here have an intrinsic knowledge of how to act within Utopia - on what side of the streets to walk, of where they are needed, where they work best, and even what order to sacrifice themselves in should the city require it. While the vast majority of visitors to the city find it stifling - the clean white walls and piercing gaze of statues around every perfect corner - the true denizens are utterly content with their place in the machine.
 
Though all of the native outsiders intrinsically know their place, that does not mean there are no disagreements in important matters. Fundamental truths are recognised, but how to deal with violations of these laws is often an area of contention. Depending on the severity of these breaches, inevitables and axiomites will continue to pass the issue upwards in the ranks until it reaches a group of sufficient station to debate the infraction. Such debates can take decades or even centuries, usually consisting of complex equations to best determine cause and effect, and especially the ramifications on the future. While these ‘Consortiums’ are not capable of determining fate to the exact detail, their calculations are often close enough to cause some mortals to doubt their own free will. If a violation of a fundamental law is too great for any of the lesser Consortiums to deal with, it will be presented to Breithmaehut, who will enact the Council of V̅I̅ - a process in which the god clones her own ‘consciousness’ with 6000 minor deviations to debate the fundamental defiance or other emergency which requires her attention. Once the Council of V̅I̅ reaches its verdict, the decision is final and all of Utopia works to enact the precise instructions given. 
 
In addition to the enactment of the enforcement of fundamental laws, one of Utopia’s most important functions is being the location that holds The Court of Deific Disputes. Initially planned to rest in Annanoris’s realm, the Forgotten God made a request for it to fall under Breithmaehut’s care in Utopia, mere decades before Pesmaenos’s betrayal - while the reason for this decision is likely now only known to The Inexorable Truth, the location has remained only occasionally contested in Utopia. The Court of Deific Disputes is, as the name would suggest, used to create bindings between gods to be enforced by all parties involved, including Breithmaehut. A deal here is not lightly made, as failure to uphold such a bargain can result in a combined deific effort to send the perpetrator to The Malus Pit. 

For souls that find themselves sent to Utopia, they first arrive at one of the many sorting gates standing at the back of a long Queue, left to look upon the scarred walls of the city and the peaks of the monumental buildings within. During this time, the petitioner has the opportunity to look inwards and try to understand the fundamental truth of themselves. Such a process can take years, and can take a toll on a soul; at any time, they are free to remove themself from the queue and wander the wasteland, but such a decision is not to be taken lightly as it requires that they rejoin at the back and restart the process. Some souls never make it to the city, and instead roam as empty, desperate husks that slowly dissolve to sand - frightening reminders to any soul who lacks resolve. It’s theorised that those who join The Queue can only move to the front once they’ve finally come to terms with themselves, but the exact function of The Queue is a highly debated topic amongst scholars, with axiomites providing no concrete answers. 

Once the petitioner has entered Utopia’s gates, they’ll find themselves quickly shuffled into sorting halls where they’ll be individually interviewed by one of the countless axiomites of the Petitioner Consortium, who will evaluate their skills, beliefs, morals, and achievements from their past life and assign a role from there. These roles are usually small jobs within the city to ensure its functioning, though some promising petitioners can be deemed worthy of immediate promotion to the path to become an axiomite or inevitable. They are not immediately transformed, but are admitted into the halls of the Unremittus where they go through intensive learning to reach what is deemed to be their ‘true potential’. Souls deemed to belong to a ‘lesser role’ are able to prove themselves worthy to join the Unremittus, though many simply accept their jobs, coming to realise they are still an important cog in the machine. Those who disagree with their judgement are given precisely one Omnian year to formulate a logical reason as to why their assigned role is incorrect; this will be evaluated by the Petitioner Consortium, and will be judged impartially as true or false, and enacted upon as per the judgement. For those who continue to refuse their role, they are allowed to wander Utopia without a duty - a fact that seems to be innately known to all of those in position. They are given three choices; to forever exist in the city as an outcast, to finally accept their assigned role, or to leave Utopia and the protection it provides to wander the waste, not to be readmitted without an impeccable reason. 
 
For a newly assigned petitioner, life within the city may seem dull, but it seems an inevitable fate for those who continue working in their positions to come to accept and eventually enjoy it. The daily life for such a petitioner is quiet and usually uneventful, but they are provided for. Despite the city’s reputation as one of machines and maths, in more recent millennia entertainment venues have been constructed for souls, stated to ‘improve quality of life’ and, perhaps more importantly, ‘boost morale and efficiency in the growing populace’.
 
For those who graduate into the Unremittus, their roles are much more strictly assigned into either becoming an axiomite or one of the many unit types of inevitables. The Unremittus itself is a continent sized university, which holds the Haxxon Forge in one half and the Breithmaen Iris in the other, facing true planar North and South respectively. Training for each assignment is incredibly specific, but consists of centuries worth of lessons, training, and meditation. The sheer amount of time and indoctrination often leaves the soul forgetting much of its past life, and the vast majority of prospective axiomites and inevitables have absolutely no trace left of their mortal selves by the end of their time in the Unremittus. There are, however, some very willful souls who manage to maintain some of their self, which often produces unwanted but tolerated deviations in the output of the Unremittus. Souls who graduate to become inevitables are sent into the yawning mouth of the Haxxon Forge, where they emerge hours later in their assigned and specially made machine body. Those who prove themselves worthy of becoming axiomites are to walk into a huge blue portal built into an otherwise blank marble wall in the Unremittus. It’s said that this portal is one of the missing eyes of Breithmaehut’s shell, but the god has not commented either way on this. When a worthy soul enters the portal, their essence is broken down into its axiomatic truths - a shimmering cloud of maths that quickly learns to reform itself into a chosen form. These new axiomites know their most efficient place in Utopia, and get about their jobs as soon as they can; many of them return to the Unremittus with the assignment to create new inevitable bodies for the Haxxon Forge.

### Script
The utopian script is a syllabary where every character represents a syllable but also the characters individually represent ideas, Syllables can be reversed to a 'receptive form' making word couplings e.g "Bre" and "Fe"  join to make the coupling "Breith" this typically symbolises a particular subsection of the second syllable or a property of the second symbol in this case the first knowledge or record. A double sylable means the opposit of a thing
