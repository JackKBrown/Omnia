## About
Forged in storm, Zhongguo is a huge landmass over the Sunken Sea from the shores of Omnia. Well separated by turbulent body of water, the people of each land have seldom met throughout history. 

The country itself is situated on the Great Crater - a huge fissure from which the elemental planes touch the material, and from which elementals of all types have spilled into the land. The mortals of Zhongguo are often born touched by these planes, and elemental sorcerers are not uncommon; indeed, these sorcerers have been paramount in the survival of civilisation in such a turbulent land. The country is massive - nearly the size of Omnia itself - and has many offshoot volcanic islands that are also inhabited. 

Unlike Omnia, Zhongguo never suffered from The Cataclysm, and so despite the dangers the temperamental elementals pose, civilisation itself has never faced an apocalyptic threat. However, that is not to say it has been stable - since time immemorial the country has been governed by a Thunder King. This title is bestowed on a person in possession of the Fēng Lóng - five artefacts that hold the Primal God of Wind, Zephrys, in a prison. The creation of these five items was completed by The Forgotten God, and the details lost with his death; regardless, the function is clear. Whoever holds all five artefacts becomes the mortal incarnation of Zephrys, and in turn controls the weather. 

The Fēng Lóng are as follows:

The Crown of Heavens
The Sword of Storms
The Sash of the Gentle Stream
The Robes of Fire
The Boots of Earth

This gives The Thunder King ultimate control of the land - dictating whose crops prosper and whose die, who can pass unharmed through waterways, and whose cities are torn down by storms. Such is the power of The Thunder King that all of Zhongguo bow the knee without question. However, the title does not come without its curse, and the God Zephrys is not something that can be caged without repercussions. Just as the weather changes, The Thunder King is a turbulent position that is often held for unpredictable times - sometimes numbered in days - as the power can consume those not who do not possess the will to subjugate the God. 

As such, only those who are driven - or perhaps foolish - enough to lead take hold of the Fēng Lóng. Eventually a monk brotherhood was developed, the Fēng Xiōn, who was tasked with steering the new king into wiser decisions, and sometimes Thunder Kings would join the brotherhood itself and let a trusted other take the political power. These trustees were named the Solemn Ones, whose duties were often thankless and their reign directly tied to the current King. 

Under the power of each Thunder King's individual leadership, the nation grew quickly but erratically, developing experimental weaponry and magic that focussed on the power of the elements. With every new king, the people experienced turbulent times - some prosperous and some disastrous, but always changing. 

## Recent History
As of 508 years ago, while Omnia was in the grasp of the Cataclysm, a new Thunder King was crowned. Unlike his predecessors, he did not take the throne after the previous King lost control of the Fēng Lóng, but rather after he managed the impossible and committed regicide.

This man is Lei Sheng, the previous Solemn One under Han Sho, and the current Thunder King. A man so hungry for power, he spent his entire duty as the Solemn One honing his will and magic to lengths that made even the Imperial Dragons nervous, with the singular goal in mind that he was to become the next and last Thunder King. 

Han Sho had been a popular King that Zhongguo has prospered under - or at least, that was the belief at the time. Lei Sheng was the one pulling the strings, directing the country and suggesting how the King exercised his power; as was to be expected of a Solemn One, this was a thankless job unrecognised by the public at large. In Lei Sheng's mind, his work was credited to an absentminded monk who would be lost without his guidance; this feeling of discontent boiled away at the Solemn One for a decade of his service, and it was in this time he started his training. He perfected his mind and body, becoming a master of magic and might alike - playing the part of a Solemn One by day, and consuming the power of Oni, dragon, and elemental alike in the secrecy of dark. 

By the end of the decade, Lei Sheng was almost the most powerful mortal in the material plane. While perhaps naught compared to the manifestation of Zephrys, he was more than cunning enough to devise a plan to slay him. As part of the Fēng Xion, Han Sho had neglected to look upon his people or his Solemn One; Lei Sheng took his ignorance as an opportunity, and organised a meeting to discuss some fictional oncoming danger. As The Thunder King's back was turned to look through the eyes of the wind at this 'oncoming disaster', Lei Sheng drew the Sword of Storms from its scabbard and thrust it through the back of Han Sho. As soon as the divine blade pierced his chest, the Thunder King fell dead - but the Sash of Gentle Streams unfurled from the body as the last beat of the King's heart thundered through his corpse and slipped from the grasp of Lei Sheng into the open air, unrelenting despite the usurper's magic.

As he gathered the remaining Fēng Lóng, Sheng wondered if the lost Sash would diminish his powers - and if it was a sign of disapproval from Zephrys. Regardless, he did not let such doubts sway him, and as he donned the final item - The Crown of Heavens - he felt the power of godhood surge through him like lightning. 

Thunder King Lei Sheng, The Usurper of the Skies and the Eternal Emperor, reins Zhongguo to this day. Insurmountably powerful even without the Sash, though unable to calm the waters of the Sunken Sea, The Eternal Emperor rules with an iron fist and has expanded Zhongguo across countless other smaller nations. Disobedience is met with death, and the people now know an era of bloody stability that has lasted far longer than any other in history. Despite his unquestioned power, Lei Sheng has hunted for the Sash so that he can claim his ultimate goal - full dominance of the Primal God Zephrys.
