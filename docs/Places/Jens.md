## Summary
A swampy city that was protected from the Calamity by mysterious crystals that sprouted from the ground. Opened up as a place for the misbegotten of society who were turned away from the other cities, Jens is now ran by powerful mob families who mete out their own Justice - often in the fighting pit called "The Maw".

## About

A city built on a swamp, jens is a multicultural place often glossed over by other city states/ countries. Founded well before the ending of the cataclysm jens is a refuge for undesirables, as well as a melting pot for many ancestries.  
Originally the town was an ancestral home for lizardfolk, but with the cataclysm many who were afflicted with minor mutations found themselves unwanted by the big cities as well as some species such as goblins, orcs, and other more chaotic peoples found themselves unwelcome. These people retreated into the wilderness were they encountered the lizardfolk many fights broke out over differences in culture but as people began to realize that the taint could not penetrate this swampy land as easily they tried to settle. Jens (short for jenseit) is the resulting cluster of settlements. The city is built on several layers clutching desperately onto trees and large rocks (the sielsteen) with different groups more commonly living in different layers the toppers (fleshwarps, orcs, goblins) living in treehouse like structures, the baruns (short for barge runners lizardfolk, humans) living atop floating buildings and running the cities barges which allow for transport without knowing what areas are safe to wade in, and the skulkers (lizardfolk, azarketi, swampweed leshy)  those that live in or below the waters surface. This gathering of people lived in relative peace with minor skirmishes and squabbles breaking out over time until the end of the cataclysm when the taint dispersed so did the people of jens leaving the unskilled and the undesirables behind to fend for themselves the city may have dissolved entirely if not for the efforts of Reglis Almock a Lizardfolk merchant with connections to outside lizardfolk caravans. They found that the sielsteen could soak up the taint explaining the resilience of the swamp and sold the sielsteen to cities wanting to remove the taints influence faster so they could expand faster. This economic boom allowed the city to stabilize and find new ventures.

## The Maw
Some of the most recent previous Champions of The Maw are as follows (in order of most recent first):
### [[Zethe|Zethe Wayright]]
The most recent champion, who disappeared only a few weeks after claiming her title. Appearing to be a mechanical statue, she was thrown into the Maw by the Alm for reasons the family has not yet disclosed. Aligning herself with no family, she was an unpopular fighter from the beginning.
They fought and defeated Vannan Hazeridge to claim the title, and returned to the Maw two weeks later to fight Draden Coll, son of the patriarch Zalfere Col, to retain her position. While she did defeat Draden, Zethe spared his life and threatened the Col family for some unknown information. Whatever the information was, she disappeared from the city soon after, and the Coll family released an official statement that Zethe was found to be an automaton created by an outside actor who wished to undermine Jens as a whole - and so they couldn’t be considered a true champion, thus losing the title. Some speculate that the Alm were attempting to use the machine to force information from the Coll and reduce the family’s grip on the Maw - a rumour that no one would dare speak to an Alm or Coll openly. 

### Draden Coll (Debated)
Draden Coll is the spoiled human first son of the patriarch of the Coll, Zalfere. While the Coll are a brutal family, they value martial pride - something that did not come naturally to Draden, who was born of short stature with a knack for losing muscle faster than he could gain it. Such a shame couldn’t be brought upon the family, and so Zalfere bought his son’s success. Draden was gifted incredibly expensive, legendary magical items which bestowed upon him the skill and strength of ten warriors with defence equivalent to a dragon’s scales. While his title of Champion is debated - as he never defeated the previous champion - it was given to him after Zethe was disqualified. The choice was deemed an unpopular one, and due to pressure from the other families, Draden was forced to step down which left the title open again. 

### Vannan Hazeridge
A powerful user of magic and sword together, Vannan was a human who took to the Maw after discovering some awful secret and having his mind broken by it. The secret died with him, but some speculate it was how he gained his destructive powers - and why he always executed his rivals in strangely ritualistic ways. 
Vannan’s past was hidden by the Nadir - his first patrons - and some believe that it was their secrets which caused both his madness and his magic. Whatever the case, he fought his way through the competition blossoming from Gregor’s retirement, leaving a trail of strange symbols written in blood in his wake. Some say that, when he was killed, they saw a flash of purple energy leave his body and disappear into the swamp.

### Gregor Bayrun
Gregor Bayrun is one of the few living ex-champions, who decided to take the easy option of retirement into the Bayrun. He’s a large human who once had a mane of dark brown hair, that’s now grey. His strength with a greathammer was unrivalled, his strength honed through years of rowing, but despite his potential for destruction, he has taken a path of peace and now lives to protect his family from the more violent families who are uneasy with any who disturb their balance.
While he was a champion of the Maw, Gregor favoured simple brutality over skill. Going into battle with the skin of a hydra draped over his back, he managed to defeat Silvia of the Shadows when her dagger became lodged into the scales and he caught her before she could retreat. Thankfully, for Silvia, it was a quick and painless death via a blow to the head. 

### Silvia of the Shadows 
Silvia of the Shadows was a fleshwarp drow whose skin had been turned translucent through the brutal experiments of her family in the underdark. Granted the power of near invisibility, at the cost of incredible pain when anything touched her skin, she managed to escape the underdark and fled into the Mawscape where she found herself quickly recruited by the Nadir, who employed her to commit multiple assassinations, intelligence gatherings, and thefts using her unique skills. 
Unfortunately for Silvia, her invisibility was not enough, and she was caught when trying to steal a priceless artefact from Leandross of the Coll, who had her unceremoniously thrown into the Maw. Her powers allowed her to thrive in the violence, and while she couldn’t hope to pay off the ridiculously large debt she owed to Leandross, she began to enjoy the slaying until she was crowned champion. Her calling card was leaving entire sections of the Maw a bloody landscape as an unseen slayer - her enemies’ last moments being confusion and terror. She slew Aspara in a rather underhand way - waiting for the champion to land in celebration before slitting her throat from behind. 

### Aspara Darkwing
Aspara Darkwing was a Strix who was captured from her mountain home by Coll raiders as a child - seeing her potential as a messenger and guard who could use her wings as an advantage over the other families. As she grew up, the violence of Jens rubbed off on her, and she began to crave a fight in the Maw - something which her Coll handlers allowed in order to reap the rewards of her winnings. 
Her wings, while tiring to fly with, gave her an almost insurmountable edge over the other competitors, and she dive bombed them with expert precision, similar to Buluc-Chabtan before them. While her lance broke upon the body of Bras’kar Ironscale, she managed to lodge the broken weapon in his throat as he tried to eat her alive, slowly killing the longstanding champion through bloodloss and sepsis. 

### Bras'kar Ironscale
A lizardman champion of the Maw who hatched from the egg with silver-white scales that were as hard as iron. Such a mutation was not to be let to waste, and Bras’kar was trained as soon as he could walk to use his hardened body in fights. By the age of 10, he could provide legitimate challenge to his trainers, and by 13 he would beat his peers 95% of the time. It seemed he was born the perfect killing machine, and the Alm sent him to the Maw to test this theory.
For over ten years, Bras’kar proved the theory correct. His competition couldn’t even scratch his metallic scales, and his incredible strength allowed him to practise his favourite method of dispatching enemies - unarmed dismembering. As his bloodlust increased, his methods became so violent that even some Jensites found it disturbing - it reached a point where Bras’kar pulled the arms from his enemies before eating them alive. 

### Buluc-Chabtan
Their name means literally First Song on the morning, exile, killer of nestling.

Exiled by the grippli years ago for killing a nestling that had pinned their sister down they left the fae travelling south until they were captured and thrown into the maw along with their companion Balin-Dali. They became the champion after they mounted their companion and took out the competition who his captures had assumed to be a wild beast that would attack contestants.
They use their agility and speed to deftly avoid and disarm their foes in the maw making a name for themselves as the mounted barabarian. They were known for their post victory ritual where they would croak in a deep melodic voice and execute injured foes stabbing them through the heart feeding it to Balin-dali.
