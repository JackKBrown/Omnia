## About
Ocean Point is a kingdom that has seen many wars for many years, but there was a brief time where it was restored to a humble merchant kingdom, transporting many things to many towns and returning with resources and foods. This was until it was hit with a great battle, the result of which left the kingdom in an unsure state.

During the time of war, Ocean Point was crowded with soldiers and protectors. Streets filled with barracks. Smoke would fill the air from artillery and sleep was very little but soon the King, Carence Vin Tarson, asked for the help of the palace sorcerer and in doing so, created The Cleaving. It was here when land was torn from land and sent drifting into the ocean. Things took a while to improve after this, normal would not be known for a few years. Until one day, the fruit and vegetables had grown and the sea was plentiful with different forms of sealife. It was a miracle. The people of Ocean Point rejoiced but a small few were suspicious of what happened. How did all this happen overnight? 

People began to disappear but no one seemed to question it. As all the fruit and vegetables grew back, as well as plenty of fish to catch, everyone was happy. This didnâ€™t last long, as yes, everything had grown back once more but it had done so in poor conditions and so once it was all harvested, it did not grow back until the land itself was made healthy again. This caused attacks to become more frequent. People were being killed for their food. 

As the years went on, the king saw so much bloodshed around him. Those few who noticed people going missing began to realise how frequent it was becoming. As well as people acting differently, great strife affecting their lives and suddnely having the answer but showing up dead a few weeks later. As the land began to grow back, it would stop and so Ocean Point was at the whim of merchant ships bringing in food from other towns.
