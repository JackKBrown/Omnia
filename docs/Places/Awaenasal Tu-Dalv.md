# Awaenasal Tu-Dalv
Grippli society is based off living as a steward for nature they work alongside natural forces and as such live comfortably within the Fae they have a firm belief in ritualistic magic such as occult, divine, and Nature but have little Arcane magic due to a lack of need. 

Awaenasal Tu-Dalv has no individual ruler but instead has a council of tribal heads although power can shift typically the two strongest positions are the Matron; tribal head of the Pond Tenders in the tribe and Magic Users (Traditionally female), and the Sky Diver; tribal head of the Eagle Riders.
