## About

Consisting of multiple islands only loosely governed by a single governor, the Trickster’s Dice is a haven for pirates and outlaws alike. A land made rich from countless less-than-scrupulous goods passing hands, it’s a popular place for many adventurers to visit despite the danger. 

While the Dice are hardly governed - with the governor position doing the bare minimum to ensure the lands don’t fall apart in civil war - it does run like a mostly normal city on a day to day basis. Unfortunately, with such a position as the governor providing some measure of power over such a rich black market, it’s bound to attract the selfish and corrupt. The Trickster’s Dice has known no shortage of cruel governors, and indeed the previous one was found to be in league with a cult of Iomatre, and was replaced in a coup by the once-captain of the Bloody Annibel.
