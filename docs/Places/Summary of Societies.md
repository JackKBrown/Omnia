## [[Asgard]]
The largest metropolitan city in Omnia, a sprawling walled city in the centre of the Sea of Bones. Considered the centre of civilisation after the Age of Reclaimation, Asgard was expansionist until 82AR where it lost a war against Hel. Despite the loss, Asgard has remained a powerful city which has seated itself as the defacto leader of [[The Limthinveil Alliance]].  Home of the Hel Knights, Gryphon Riders, and capitol of Breithmaen worship, Asgard is likely the most powerful city in Omnia.

## [[Hel]]
The patron city of [[Pesmaenos]], and the controlling power of the Golden Road, the road which allows trade between Asgard and New Methymaenos, Hel is a city built from both self-empowerment and the blood of slaves. A city in which anyone can gamble anything in their possession - including their lives - to win it all. However, as is true in any gambling hall, the house always wins.

## [[Crozetta]]
An old city built long before the Calamity, and now part of the Limthinveil Alliance, Crozetta is a peaceful port city with an ancient sewage network that connects to the Underdark. It's a major exporter of fish, with the inner kingdoms being the main benefactors.

## [[Jens]]
A swampy city that was protected from the Calamity by mysterious crystals that sprouted from the ground. Opened up as a place for the misbegotten of society who were turned away from the other cities, Jens is now ran by powerful mob families who mete out their own Justice - often in the fighting pit called "The Maw".

## [[New Methymaenos]]
The new home of the dwarves, built upon the ruins of their old civilisation that collapsed to the rising of Alathoth Ebonwing. Controlling the vast majority of the North, the dwarven capital is unfriendly to outsiders and preferred to keep its trade within its stoney walls. To prevent a similar fate befalling their new home, the dwarves devised a rising floor for their city, allowing them to hide their civilisation underground should they be attacked again.

## The Greywall
Home of [[The Watch]] and the northernmost point of civilisation before Omnia turns into The Waste. Built by a collaboration of the Methymaenion dwarfs and Squeekhaven ratfolk, this bastion stands against the tide of demons and undead which roam the wasteland ahead of it. Lead by their High Praetor, [[Hrothgan Warforged]], and manned by Omnia's strongest heroes and the WISP automotons, civilisation rests easy in the knowledge The Watch is guarding them.

## The Wastes
The Wastes are a sprawling tundra filled with monstrous creatures, mysterious ruins, and potent magical energy. While no one is certain about the origins of this wasteland, it is thought to have been the origin point of the Cataclysm, being that the deadly mutagenic cloud spread from the north. Some scholars have suggested that the ruins here may well have been created by the people who caused the Cataclysm, but any conclusive evidence is impossible to come by without someone putting their life in great danger.

## [[The Trickster's Dice]]
A pirate city in the southernmost islands of Omnia, The Trickster's Dice are a lawless land governed by bribes and might - though a recent change to leadership may put an end to that. The patron city of the Trickster, The Trickster's Dice offers freedom and danger in equal measure, and for those with the gall to try, there's a lot of gold to be gathered in the Dice.

## [[Roziegalburg]]
The stone and brick capital of Omnia, exporting both to the surrounding cities. Protected on all sides by a large mountain range and part of the Limthinveil Alliance, Roziegalburg benefits from this security and often uses this safely gathered power to challenge Asgard. While they would not match the great desert city in a war of might, they know full well how much their exports are relied upon - and how many knives are levied towards Asgard's back.

## [[The Limthinveil Alliance|Alliance People]]
The people from this region consist mostly of Humans, orks, elves, halflings and gnomes of mixed heritages it is a boiling pot of culture though and has many species outside of those listed above.

## [[Fae Grippli]]

## [[Lost Continent Grippli]]
