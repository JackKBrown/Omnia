Built in the ravine of old methemenos this city is a testament to dwarven resilience or maybe stubbornness depending who you ask. The old city was built inside the mountain range known as Varanth's Spine which according to legend was the final resting place of the progenitor of all dragons. This myth soon became fact when the mountain range was resurrected by a powerful lich almost 300 years ago in an era of great strife.

Dragon and Dwarf now live together in this rebuilt city, and some would say the ancient dwarven kingdom is stronger than ever under this new alliance.
