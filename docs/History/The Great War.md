A documentation of the Age of Sigmar narrative game write ups, set in Omnia's past (78AR) in the Sea of Bones. 

Game 1
On the shores of the seaside settlement of Adiseigo - a small offshoot colony of Asgard - a foul tide gathered. Citizens had been tormented by unnatural wailing carried on the waters in the dead of night, and fishing boats had washed up vacant, devoid of both crew and cargo. Seeing this as an opportunity to test their newfound strength, the newly formed Godforged were dispatched to investigate the issue. 

When they arrived, they found Adiseigo beset by ghouls. The citizens had locked themselves into their houses, but their wooden walls wouldn't last long under assault. Worse still, the undead had brought forth a rotting winged beast with claws sharp enough to slice through Breithmaetite and a screech potent enough to rupture organs. The monster had taken to peeling apart houses to let the ghouls flood in, but that quickly stopped as they noticed the encroaching Godforged. With an ear piercing shriek, the undead surged forward and met divine steel with necromantically enhanced claws. 

Paladin and ghoul were torn asunder as the clash reached its apex, but as Knight Ebriham marched to meet the Abhorrent King atop his monstrous mount, another roar echoed through the stricken town. Skimming the sea mist, four massive dragons flew ashore, immediately wreaking havoc on the buildings beneath them. With a harsh laugh at the new challenge, the Ghoul King forced his mount to take flight and clash with an encroaching blue dragon in midair; the two beasts scrambled with one another until the undead monster broke free, tearing a huge chunk of the blue dragon's neck off along with it. Before it could escape and regain its strength, the wyrm gave chase, seemingly unbothered by the gaping wound, and tore through the undead monstrosity.

On the ground, ghoul and Godforged looked to one another and understood - the only way they would survive is by joining forces against the oncoming threat. Paladins held the line as a gargantuan red dragon charged through the town square; the undead tore at its scales whilst the knights stabbed at its underbelly. Ebriham moved to challenge the dragon, sword in hand and heart pounding in his chest; his augmented body was strong, yes, but still no match for the ancient wyrm. The beast narrowed its eyes and seemed to smirk as the oncoming challenge, knowing full well this mortal could do little more than scratch its hide. Sword blow after sword blow, the monster remained unfazed; occasionally it clawed back, but more akin to the way a cat toys with a cornered mouse. While his armour allowed him to keep his vigor - its white metal knitting together his wounds - he knew it was only a matter of time before the dragon stopped playing with its food. It was at that point a terrible roar commanded the attention of the battlefield, and the red wyrm turned its head to see its blue companion overwhelmed by ghoul and paladin alike, injured and forced to retreat. Its indignant shock provided Ebriham the perfect opportunity to stab his blade into the beast's eye; it reeled backwards before taking off, leaving the seaside town and fleeing across the waves once again…

Game 1 - Sons of Drakkon
White hot pain. Khalgorak the fervor let out a Bellow of indignation. How dare this... this... this MORTAL leave a single scratch on his resplendent body. Clawing desperately into the air like a cat struggling to find purchase on a sodden wall Khalgorak could see his foremost General, Nithicin the Storm, laid low ghouls overrunning her body. With a bath of flame he cleared the pests pulling her body to safety. 
This had not been the victory he had sought, mortals seemingly had some tricks that he was not used to, the necromantic arts for one had advanced considerably since his time how dare they descrate his kin they would burn for this. Then there was those armoured warriors. That armour... He glanced back at the figure in marble and gold, his one good eye burning with rage. The figure looked back, resolve in his eyes. Yes all would burn Especially THAT one!

Game 1 - The Forsaken Fleet
As the crimson dawn broke over the battered settlement of Adiseigo, Captain Darkmoor stood atop the crumbling remnants of a shattered house, surveying the aftermath. The scent of blood hung thick in the air, mingling with the acrid stench of charred wood. His ghouls, their ghastly forms still trembling with the aftershocks of battle, gathered around him, their hunger momentarily sated by the flesh of the fallen.

The battle had been fierce, and the alliance with the Godforged, however fleeting, had been unexpected. Darkmoor’s mind raced, replaying the clash of steel and claw, the roars of dragons, and the desperate cries of mortals. His mount, the monstrous beast that had been torn asunder by the blue dragon, lay in ruins, a testament to the ferocity of their adversaries.

Despite the victory over the dragons, Darkmoor felt a pang of frustration. The Heart of Dread’s curse weighed heavily upon him, its dark whispers gnawing at the edges of his sanity. The necromancer’s promise had brought them this far, but the path to true freedom remained elusive.

“Gather the remains,” he commanded, his voice a guttural growl that echoed through the stillness. His ghouls obeyed, scavenging the battlefield for any remnants of their foes and allies alike. Flesh was precious, and their hunger insatiable.

As his minions worked, Darkmoor turned his gaze to the horizon. The dragons had retreated, their arrogance shattered by the combined might of ghoul and paladin. But he knew they would return. The ancient wyrms were not so easily defeated, and their thirst for vengeance would drive them back to Adiseigo.

“Captain,” a voice rasped from behind him. It was Thorne, his loyal first mate, now a ghoul knight twisted by the curse yet retaining a semblance of his former self. “What are our orders?”

Darkmoor clenched his decayed fists, the hunger gnawing at his insides. “We prepare,” he said, his voice resolute. “The dragons will come again, and when they do, we shall be ready. But more than that, we must seek out the necromancer. His power is our key to breaking this curse.”

Thorne nodded, his eyes gleaming with a malevolent hunger. “And the Godforged?”

A twisted smile crept across Darkmoor’s face. “They were worthy allies today, but do not mistake them for friends. When the time comes, we will feast on their flesh as well. For now, let them think they have won a respite. It will make their downfall all the sweeter.”

The ghoul lord cast one last glance at the ruins of Adiseigo. The settlement had withstood the onslaught, but it was a hollow victory. The true battle lay ahead, in the depths of forbidden lore and the dark pacts yet to be forged.

“Let the tale of the Forsaken Fleet spread,” he murmured, more to himself than to his men. “Let them fear the night, and the shadows that dwell within it. We are the Flesh-Eating Courts, and we shall not rest until our hunger is sated, and our curse lifted.”

With that, Captain Darkmoor descended from his perch, his tattered cloak billowing in the breeze. The ghouls followed, a spectral procession of death and decay, as they melted back into the mists from whence they came. The seas would be their hunting grounds, and the coastal cities their feasting halls.

The endless quest continued, driven by hunger, hatred, and a glimmer of hope that one day, the Forsaken Fleet might sail free once more.

Game 1 - The Godforged
The men and women of the Godsworn dragged themselves up off the bloodsoaked ground as the dragons and ghouls left. Adiseigo was scarred, but still mostly intact, with the majority of its population alive. Grievous wounds had been healed by the white metal - even replacing lost limbs and organs; the potency of the regeneration was so great that all who fell in battle were able to return home to their families the next day.

Though, the people who returned were not necessarily the same as those who left…
