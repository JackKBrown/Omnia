## Notes by [[Frbl]]
On the dawn of all things there is only speculation many accounts attribute the creation of the universe to death of another. Some primordial being slivering through the cracks of that ending reality into our own starting events that would lead to the birth of omnia. Indeed this narrative is most commonly parroted by Diatarichtites who believe the [[Diatarachtos|many headed god]] sees into all realities and possibilities. Others believe that the universe was born from the misted breath of the [[Lyvathean]] which now wishes only to devour what it lost. We may never know the true fact of our world's origins but we can know the stories told about it.

## Pre [[Material Plane]]
- The first Elemental planes are created: Fire, Earth, Water, and air. They stew in unbridled rage for timeless eons their borders unbound and bleeding into the void scattering debris and energy that will become the building blocks of all other existance.
- As matter is created Temporal laws begin to form with it the start of history [[Katalixi]], Along with time the physical laws begin and the planes are seperated into their own borders including the seperation of [[Utopia]] from the [[Maelstrom]]. This is the origin of [[Breithmaehut]]. 
- Omnia is in a state of primordial soup, concepts being born for the first time enemies being made.

## Material Plane
- The Divine spark needed to create life was created here [[Ananoris]] this was the catalyst that was needed to bring the material plane together.
- The Fey is made at some point here? A midway plane between the material and aethereal plane

## [[The Lost Age]] 
- Despite popular belief by some, elves were not the original inhabitants of omnia the first mortals were [[The Old Ones]] the watchers. Very little is know about the old ones as with their exit from this universe they took with them knowledge about their people.
- After this many other mortal species began to emerge such as elves mortals created by [[Ananoris]] With the intent of  protecting nature

## [[The first Age]]
- With the departure of the old ones mortals swept in to take their place creating many eras of growth and tribulation, not much is remembered about this age and is mostly talked about in reference to before the age of gold. scholars disagree on exactly how advanced peoples were in these times and although legends say that the forgotten god brought about the dawn of the new age granting mortals power over magic and their own destiny some argue that this was inevitable as mortals discovered further tools and technology.
- Agathions are born during this age including [[Illuminir]], other more pagen gods such as [[Comasation]] are born during this 
- Magic is still new in this age, majority of magic is primal or occult. Most magic historians point out that divine magic likely evolved from occult magic and generally the first recorded wizards mark the beginning of the age of gold.

## [[The Age of Gold]] / The never ending age (~ 1000 years)
- Heralded in by [[The Forgotten God]] Lord of [[Illustria]] and the formation as well as the formation of the [[Holy Triumvirate]]. This includes the rebirth of [[Breithmaehut]] as a god not just of natural order but social order as well. 
- Large empires form including the dwarf kingdoms, Remus and K'thak

## [[The age of Disparity]] / The age of conquest (~100 years)
- With rapid growth and prosperity comes the ability to hoarde wealth this age begins with great famine after 3 very harsh winters leading to famine and strife between the haves and have nots. This leads to governments struggling to maintain control and declaring needless wars against other kingdoms.
- [[Wheel Quest]] takes place and the bane of [[Lyvathean]] is created
- One of the shortest ages its ended with the death of [[The Forgotten God]] in the great blasphemy and the fall of [[Pesmaenos]]. [[Iroas]] becomes lord of [[Illustria]] and the [[Holy Triumvirate]] falls apart.

## [[The Age of the Godless]] 
- A simple age as kingdoms fall apart and splinter kingdoms are formed
- after the wars of the age of disparity this is mostly an age of peace, with very few monsterous creatures around due to the shadow of the great empires it only really ends after monsters begin to come back to the 'civilised' lands

## [[The penatent Age]] (900 - 400 BR)
- Many minor evil outsiders begin to form as well as some major forces such as [[Iumater]] this marks a turn from godlessness and a return to efforts to better life for all peoples a testament to the resiliance of man
- [[Apovidex]] is born

## [[The Age of steel]] (700 - 400 BR)
- Many scholars mirror this age against the age of gold, but the key feature of this age is one of technological growth and marvel. 
- Guns are invented in this age 
- arcane magic makes a massive resurgance, many modern spells are created during this age 
- This age ends with the cataclysm, a disaster made from arcane magic causing a poisonous magic fog to spread across the land.

## [[The age of Chaos]] (400 - 0 BR)
- this age marks the largest die off of mortal races, more than 99% of all mortals die during the first fifty years of this age, very few cities survive including [[Hel]], [[Methymaenos]], [[Asgard]], and [[The Trickster's Dice]]. Their growth is limited by arable land.
- [[Breithmaehut]] uses a considerable amount of power to alter some mortals ability to survive the fog leading to a caste known as mistlings who could go out and forage.
- The end of this age is marked by [[Utopia Quest]]

	- Rising Tensions between Asgard and Hel lead to a declaration of war the preperations are swift within 2 months the forces of asgard are amassed at the outskirts of Hel along the Infernal Road.

- 90 AR
	- Asgardian influence has struggled over the last decade and in an effort to maintain an image of control over the southern states they hurry effort for the founding and reinforcing of southern colonies.
