Arriving in Falcon's Hollow, the party were informed of a missing person who had disappeared in the Darkmoon Veil, a burgeoning plague, and an intelligent wolf who was harassing the logging companies. Falcon's Hollow itself was a rundown town ruled by the iron fist of the Kreed family and their lackeys.  

Setting off into the veil, they came across an ancient ruin of a temple of Iroas, which had become the house of the Truescale kobolds - alongside the Darkmoon Beast. Making a deal with Greypelt, they ventured deeper in and discovered a kobold Warren which was ruled by King Meroklep. The Truescale kobolds had recently been attacked by a wizard who had rampaged through their Warren to search deeper - Drazmorg, a wizard expelled from Leirhyme due to 'unethical use of magic'. In his violent search, he accidentally unearthed the Crown of Domination which was quickly stolen by Meroklep, who ventured in after him. After the party scared off the remaining Truescales, they learned the place was now called Droskar's Crucible, and that it was once an Iroan Cult who lost their way to a mysterious entity called Droskar. Droskar was a manifestation of Hallowhusk, the Siktempora of Blasphemy, born from the divine emotional caused by the slaying of the Forgotten God, who strives to twist divine intent and drive the holy to blaspheme. 

Drazmorg had discovered a seal deeper within the Crucible, which he overloaded with magic. Doing so caused the already aged and damages seal to shatter, weakening the Iroan-forged locks that once bound the Siktempora from the material plane. The energy raised the dead and began funneling into Meroklep's crown, empowering the Kobold King.

The party eventually discovered Drazmorg and put an end to him, though found the seal utterly beyond repair. Regardless of the wizard's defeat, the Kobold King Meroklep was still receiving the ambient power into the crown, and so they ventured to the final level of the Crucible to put an end to the king. Upon slaying Meroklep and destroying the crown, the resonant energy of the seal was free to  cling to the martial plane - weakening the gap between it and the Astral Plane where the Siktempora form. 

Upon returning to Falcon's Hollow, the team took to launching an assault on the Kreed household after stirring up rebellion with a ruse of using Waylen's demon as a false manifestation of the Kreed's evil. After fighting through their remaining loyal guards, they came across Thuldrin Kreed, who accidentally manifested the physical embodiment of the Misery his family had created - a powerful Siktempora. While the party did slay it, it's likely only the beginning of the troubles Omnia will face from the weakened planar barrier.

Epilogue
Waylen
After defeating the Kreed family, Waylen staged the defeat of his Demon by his own hands, securing his place in the hearts of the people. Seen as a benevolent leader, he was supported as the new ruler of Falcon's Hollow. Of course, while he needs to keep up his pretense of 'Holy Saviour' on the surface, he's very happy to engage in backroom dealings with benefactors, including pirates. 

Despite his dark ties and greed, Waylen is a much 'kinder' ruler than the ones before him, and only a very select few know otherwise. 

Nori
Taking a large chunk of the wealth that once belonged to the Kreed family with him, Nori returned to his crew alongside Cal - victorious and rich. With such a large bounty and increased magical aptitude, the crew's respect for Nori was at an all time high. Enough that he could suggest the next raids and adventurers to the captain and they'd actually be likely to listen. Wherever the crew left a port, a new song telling of their daring deeds was sure to ring through the docks for months afterwards. 

While his adventures at sea have only just started anew, he did make an odd request (backed by his new wealth) to return to Ocean Pointâ€¦

Cal
Cal initially joined with Nori on the ship, alongside their tremendous wealth. But she knew that despite her skills as a pirate, it wasn't the life for her - not when Ocean Point was still under the grip of a mysterious cult. Despite her adventures, she was still technically the prisoner of the crew, and while she could probably fight her way through them, she opted for a more peaceful solution working alongside Nori. 

Nori persuaded the captain to head to Ocean Point, and while there, Cal faked her own dead and fled the port. Now she seeks more information about the Cult that's rotting her home from the inside - and with her newfound power, she can make some real waves in Ocean Point. 

Altair
Content with the heroism and style he had brought to the dreary Falcon's Hollow, Altair decided to take his leave from the town and pursue the cracked seal - and perhaps a way to repair it. Deciding the best place to learn of ancient magic, he headed onwards to Laerhyme, and then to Asguard to learn of the power the old high priest used to maintain the seal. 

Whatever answers he may find, Altair's journey to stop the Siktempora is just beginning - and it's likely to lead into more peril than he's ever known before. Of course, that will be no problem for the leading man!
