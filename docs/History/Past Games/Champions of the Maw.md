Fighting their way up the ranks of the Maw, a group that called themselves the Firestarters managed to topple the rule of the Coll and become Maw Lords under the Almions. 

Chazzak, Jennick, Seraphina, and Gnerk proved their might, fighting monsters from all around Jens - and under it - to prove their strength to the entire city-state. Through honor and allies, they killed the heir to the Coll - Draden - as well as the mad doctor Sssiff Kowl, who hoped to summon the presence of his dark god Uber-Seccentium, and the partially mechanised self-proclaimed King of the Swamp Largol Putridtooth.

Not content with just earning their place in the city's history, the Firestarters discovered the locations of eight ancient sites that each held powerful gems. With the assistence of Wilmin Barleyshire, they fought through monsters of the past and present to collect each gem, all while being hounded by the silent and empty Stratholl Cant. 

After claiming their title, they were attacked by Stratholl; while they defeated his body, they discovered he was empty - a hole into the absense - and he transformed into two horrific abberants. Once dead, the party discovered the final temple which the gems opened. Stratholl Cant's - or as they discovered his name to actually be, Abraxos - soul rested within and told the party that they were going to disturb an item of unquestionable evil called Lyvathean's Eye. They may get a wish out of it, but they would cause untold evil to fall upon the material plane.

The Firestarters debated amongst themselves, but decided that they would not accept the wish, and left Abraxos to his post while they became the new gaurdians of the gems. Wilmin was furious with them but didn't attack, instead electing to dissapear into the night as a wanted criminal of the Alm - unwelcome into Jens ever again.

Key Changes:
  - The Almion now control the Maw through the new Mawlords, Chazzak, Jennick, Seraphina, and Gnerk
  - The Gems of the Forgotten God are now known about, and the threat of the Eye still remains - while the gems are safe for now, that doesn't mean that others won't come for them
  - Uber-Seccentium's Blood in Jens has been destroyed, and so her presence has severly waned in the area, freeing Jens from her presence
